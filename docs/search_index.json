This project was deemed relevant to Oceans and Climate Change science due to the need to improve understanding of how multiple drivers interact to affect the integrity of ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales, and to improve evaluation of the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple drivers. Furthermore, marine spatial planning approaches for the use and conservation of marine resources are required, particularly in the context of fluctuating natural and human drivers. A recent project led by our team developed marine spatial planning approaches and tools to evaluate the cumulative effects of multiple environmental drivers on the ecological communities of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada (Beauchesne, 2020), hereafter referred to as the St. Lawrence System. This project identified four specific goals: Evaluate the distribution and intensity of environmental drivers in the St. Lawrence System; Characterize the spatial structure of the ecological communities of the St. Lawrence System; Evaluate the vulnerability of ecological communities to multiple drivers; Assess the cumulative effects of global changes on the ecological communities of the St. Lawrence System from the cartography of drivers (Obj. 1) and communities (Obj. 2), as well as the vulnerability of communities to multiple drivers (Obj 3). A component of this project consisted of developing and launching the open knowledge platform eDrivers (Beauchesne et al., 2020) to facilitate the process of gathering experts committed to structuring, standardizing and sharing knowledge on drivers in support of science and management. Data on 22 coastal, climate, fisheries and marine traffic drivers were summarized through collaborations, existing environmental initiatives and open data portals. The distribution of over 200 species was modeled and predicted throughout the St. Lawrence System, a simulation approach was used to infer the vulnerability of individual species in the St. Lawrence as a function of their position in complex food webs, and a spatially explicit evaluation of cumulative effects on the ecological communities of the St. Lawrence was generated. The current project aimed to apply and further develop the approaches and tools created in the St. Lawrence System to the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion using a species-distribution and vulnerability mapping approach. This project will benefit efficient, adaptive and holistic ecosystem-based management approaches that use marine spatial tools in the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion. Making data on drivers and ecological communities readily accessible will enhance the ability to provide efficient, consistent, and timely science guidance. This project will foster efficient and functional open science by using and further developing the fully open, transparent and replicable open knowledge platform eDrivers. This project also offers continuity and comparability between data products from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the offshore Scotian Shelf bioregion. Comparability between ecosystems is an important aspect to support the Oceans and Climate Change Science program at DFO. Furthermore, this project creates and generates data layers that will be useful for Marine Spatial Planning purposes. "],["scope-and-objectives-of-the-assessment.html", "2 Scope and objectives of the assessment 2.1 Objectives 2.2 Spatial and temporal scope", " 2 Scope and objectives of the assessment 2.1 Objectives The specific objectives of this project were to: provide a systematic characterization of the distribution and intensity of environmental drivers; assess the spatial structure of biological communities; evaluate the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple drivers, and; conduct a spatial assessment of the cumulative effects of drivers on individual species and at the community level, using outputs from objectives 1 (distribution and intensity of drivers), 2 (spatial structure of biological communities), and 3 (food web vulnerability simulations due to multiple drivers). 2.2 Spatial and temporal scope The region for which the cumulative effects assessment was conducted covers the Scotian Shelf Bioregion, located off the eastern coast of Canada in the Atlantic Ocean [Figure 2.1; Fisheries and ceans Canada (2009) Fisheries and ceans Canada (2010)]. The study area includes the Bay of Fundy to the West, stop just before the Laurentian Channel to the East, and extends towards the continental shelf. The whole study area covers an area of 415 341 \\(km^2\\). For this assessment, we divided this area in a regular grid formed of cells of ~1 \\(km^2\\). Figure 2.1: Limits of the study area for the cumulative effects assessment of global changes on the ecological communities of the Scotian Shelf Bioregion. The temporal scope of the data was defined by the availability of data on environmental drivers on the Scotian Shelf Bioregion; we considered data from 2010 up to today and divided the assessment in two periods, i.e. from 2010 to 2015 (period 1) and from 2016 to 2021 (period 2). Drivers data for which temporal timeseries spanning this timeframe were unavailable (e.g. shipping) used the same data for both periods (see section 6.1 and Table 6.1). Data on species occurrences were not divided by period and a single distribution was modelled for all species considered in the assessment (see section 6.2). "],["ceasection.html", "3 Cumulative Effects Assessment", " 3 Cumulative Effects Assessment The cumulative effects assessment (CEA) framework stems from natural resource management and environmental impact assessment regulartory processes (Halpern and Fujita, 2013). CEA has been part of environmental legislation for decades in certain countries, including the United States (National Environmental Policy Act 40 CFR 1508.7, 1969), Canada (Canadian Environmental Assessment Act S.C. 1992, c. 37, now the Impact Assessment Act 2019 22 (1)(a)(ii)), Australia, and various European countries (Halpern and Fujita, 2013). There is therefore a rich literature providing various definitions, guiding principles for assessments and best practice guides for assessment approaches (Duinker et al., 2013; Hegmann et al., 1999; Krausman and Harris, 2011; e.g. Peterson et al., 1987; Therivel and Ross, 2007). The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (Conseil canadien des ministres de l’environnement, 2014) defines cumulative effects as “changes in the environment caused by multiple interactions among human activities and natural processes that accumulate across space and time.” Cumulative effects assessment is defined as “a systematic process of identifying, analyzing and evaluating cumulative effects”. These definitions hint at the systems view of cumulative effects assessment and how it relates to an ecosystem-based management approach focusing on the structure of ecosystems as a whole (Christensen et al., 1996; Leslie and McLeod, 2007; Rosenberg and McLeod, 2005). From a policy, legislative, and regularoty standpoint, however, cumulative effects are defined more narrowly (Jones, 2016). The 1992 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act defines cumulative effects as follows: “[…] the cumulative environmental effects [of a project] that are likely to result from the project in combination with other projects or activities”. Assessments are thus usually undertaken at the scale of individual projects rather than through a systematic lense. Regional and systematic approaches to cumulative effects assessments are however gaining support (e.g. Dubé, 2003; Duinker and Greig, 2006; Jones, 2016; Sinclair et al., 2017). According to Sinclair et al. (2017), a regional cumulative effects assessment can be defined as follows: ”[A Regional Effects Assessment (REA)] is an [environmental assessment] whose primary or sole defining feature is its regional scope and its focus on understanding the interactions between human activities and the natural world. This means that in just about all aspects other than its spatial limitations, an REA should be comprehensive and integrated.” Regional approaches focus on the total effects and viability of environmental receptors of interest, commonly referred to as valued components (Beanlands and Duinker, 1983; Sinclair et al., 2017). Several constraints limit its practical application, especially access to quality data to establish the effects of one or more stressors on a valued component. These types of measures are particularly difficult to obtain in cumulative effects assessments. A study by Halpern et al. (2008) took a major step toward an ecosystem-based perspective to cumlative effects assessment. In their work, Halpern et al. (2008) evaluated the cumulative effects of 17 environmental stressors on 20 types of marine ecosystems and showed that few environments remain free of environmental pressures. Updates published in 2015 (Halpern et al., 2015) and 2019 (Halpern et al., 2019) also show general increases in cumulative effects across the global oceans. In addition to being used worldwide, this method has been used many times in different regions of the globe to characterize cumulative effects, including in California (Halpern et al., 2009), the Arctic (Afflerbach et al., 2017; Andersen et al., 2015), and the Canadian Pacific Ocean (Ban et al., 2010; Clarke Murray et al., 2015b, 2015a; Singh et al., 2020). Recently, Beauchesne (2020) expanded on the work of Halpern et al. (2008) to develop a new approach to assess cumulative effects on species that explicitely considers the underlying web of interactions structuring communities. This work built on the ecological understanding that environmental pressures indirectly propagate through ecological communities by way of species interactions (Bascompte, 2009; Estes et al., 2011; Estes and Palmisano, 1974; Paine, 1980; Wootton, 2002), i.e species cannot be considered in a vacuum (Beauchesne et al., 2021; Gilarranz et al., 2016, 2017; O’Gorman et al., 2019; O’Gorman and Emmerson, 2009; Tylianakis et al., 2008; Waller et al., 2020). Beauchesne (2020) used to approach to perform a cumulative effects assessment of global changes on the food webs of the St. Lawrence System in eastern Canada. They uncovered cumulative effects to species that would otherwise have been overlooed had species interactions been ignored, especially for fishes and marine mammals. The approaches developed by Halpern et al. (2008) and Beauchesne (2020) form the basis of the work presented in the current assessment. In the remainder of this report, we refer to the approach developed by Halpern et al. (2008) as a species-scale cumulative effects assessment, while that of Beauchesne (2020) is refered to as a network-scale cumulative effects assessment. Both approaches are presented and applied to perform a cumulative effects assessment of global changes on the food webs of the Scotian Shelf bioregion. "],["method.html", "4 Assessment method 4.1 General models 4.2 Partial models 4.3 Data requirements", " 4 Assessment method 4.1 General models 4.1.1 Species-scale assessment The method developed by Halpern et al. (2008) uses 3 types of data: 1) the mapped presence or absence of valued components, i.e. species in this case (\\(S_i\\)), 2) the spatial distribution and relative intensity (i.e. normalized between 0 and 1) of the environmental drivers considered (\\(D_j\\)), and 3) the species-specific sensitivity of each species to each driver (\\(\\mu_{i,j}\\)) These data are then incorporated into a grid made up of cells of homogeneous size characterizing the study area. Cumulative effect predictions (\\(C_S\\)) are calculated for each cell (\\(x\\)) of the grid by summing up all individual driver effects over the set of species considered: \\[C_{S_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^m S_{i,x} * D_{j,x} * \\mu_{i,j} \\label{eq1}\\] This method proposes the calculation of a relative indicator of cumulative effects to predict the risks associated with the effects of multiple environmental drivers on species. This is in opposition to an absolute indicator of effects, which would identify an observable change in the state of species populations resulting from the effects of cumulative environmental drivers, such as a decline in the beluga whale population in the St. Lawrence Estuary in response to cumulative environmental drivers. A relative indicator instead allows for a comparison of the various environmental drivers according to their intensity within the region studied and their effects on the species considered. The results are therefore more appropriately as a probability of risk. The results of the cumulative effects assessment using this approach are presented in section 7.3 of the report. Cumulative effects predictions can be decomposed to explore the relative contribution of all combinations of drivers and species (Figure 4.1). A complete exploration of all driver-species combinations is therefore possible (Figure 4.1). Figure 4.1: A fictitious example of spatial assessment of cumulative effects using the methodology suggested by (Halpern et al., 2008). The assessment begins by delineating a study area of interest (A). A picture of the study area is then made by characterizing the distribution of environmental stressors (B) and the valued components (C) allowing the assessment objectives to be reached. The summation of all the environmental stressors allows us to identify the environments that are most exposed to cumulative stress, i.e. cumulative exposure (D). The sum of valued components, on the other hand, allows us to identify the environments in the study area where a higher number of valued components overlap (E). By combining the distribution of environmental stressors and valued components along with the vulnerability of the valued components to the environmental stressors, a relative assessment of individual effects is obtained (F). It is possible to assess the impact of all the environmental stressors on a single valued component (G); similarly, it is possible to assess the impact of a single environmental stressor on all valued components (H). Finding the sum of all the individual impacts provides the relative assessment of cumulative effects incorporating all combinations of environmental stressors and valued components (I). 4.1.2 Network-scale assessment The approach developed by Beauchesne (2020) builds on recent progress in theoretical ecology (Beauchesne et al., 2021; Stouffer et al., 2007, 2012) to predict the net effects of environmental drivers by considering both direct and trophically-mediated indirect effects in ecological communities. The approach focuses on sub-networks of interacting species called motifs (Milo et al., 2002). Motifs are subsets of \\(p\\)-species interactions that, when put together, construct whole food webs and provide a mesoscale characterization of the structural properties of ecological communities (Bascompte and Melián, 2005; Bramon Mora et al., 2018; Stouffer et al., 2007; Stouffer and Bascompte, 2010, 2011). In a \\(n\\)-species food web (\\(n \\geq p\\)), the collection of \\(p\\)-species motifs (\\(p \\leq n\\)) in which species \\(i\\) is involved in (\\(M_i = \\{m_{i,1},m_{i,2},...,m_{i,x}\\}\\)) forms its motif census [\\(M_i\\); Stouffer et al. (2012); Beauchesne et al. (2021)]. The motif census provides an overview of all the interactions likely to affect the propagation of environmental pressure to a focal species. Only the most abundant 3-species motifs observed in empirical food webs are considered [i.e. trophic food chain, omnivory, exploitative and apparent composition; Camacho et al. (2007); Stouffer and Bascompte (2010)] to assess a species motif census. For any 3-species motif \\(m_{i,x}\\) in species \\(i\\)’s motif census (\\(M_i\\)), the net effect of all drivers on the 3 species is evaluated as the sum of their direct effects on all species involved – that is, the sum of species-specific responses \\(S_{m_{i,x}}\\) – as in Halpern et al. (2008): \\[S_{m_{i,x}} = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\sum_j D_j * \\mu_{k,j} \\label{eq2}\\] where \\(k\\) denotes the 3 species involved in motif \\(m_{i,x}\\), \\(D_j\\) is the standardized intensity of driver \\(j\\) (scaled between 0 and 1; see Environmental drivers module) and \\(\\mu_{k,j}\\) is the relative species-specific sensitivity of species \\(k\\) to driver \\(j\\) (range between 0 and 1; see Species-specific sensitivity module). The relative contribution of drivers to direct effects are those that affect focal species \\(i\\), whereas the relative contribution to indirect effects are those that affect the species interacting with species \\(i\\) in \\(m_{i,x}\\). A species sensitivity to trophically-mediated effects – which we refer to as a species’ trophic sensitivity (\\(T_{i,m_{i,x}}\\)) – also depends on the structure of the community, its trophic position and the specific entry points of stressors in the system (see Beauchesne et al., 2021). For instance, a predator in a food chain will more sensitive to the propagation of environmental pressures than a resource. We use simulated trophic sensitivities as weighting factors (scaled between 0 and 1) to modulate the effects of stressors to focal species \\(i\\)’s given its position in 3-species motifs and the specific pathways of effects – i.e. the entry points – through which stressors affect interacting species (see Trophic sensitivity module and Beauchesne et al. (2021) for more details): \\[C_{i,m_{i,x}} = T_{i,m_{i,x}} * S_{m_{i,x}} \\label{eq3}\\] where \\(C_{i,m_{i,x}}\\) is the cumulative effect of all drivers on species \\(i\\) in \\(m_{i,x}\\), and \\(T_{i,m_{i,x}}\\) is the trophic sensitivity of species \\(i\\) to the effects of drivers in \\(m_{i,x}\\). For a single species \\(i\\), cumulative effects are then summarized by averaging the cumulative effects across its motif census to obtain an unbiased measure of the topological configuration of species interactions (Stouffer et al., 2012): \\[C_{N_{i,x}} = \\frac{1}{|M_i|} \\sum_{m _{i,x} \\in M_i} C_{i,m_{i,x}} \\label{eq4}\\] where \\(C_{N_i}\\) is the network-scale cumulative effects assessment on species \\(i\\) and \\(|M_i|\\) is the number of motifs in the motif census of species \\(i\\). Finally, we summarize over all \\(n\\) species locally to obtain a community-aggregated assessment of network-scale cumulative effects: \\[C_N = \\sum_i C_{N_i} \\label{eq5}\\] The full model for network-scale cumulative effects assessment is thus: \\[C_N = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{|M_i|} \\sum_{m_{i,x} \\in M_i} T_{i,m_{i,x}} * \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\sum_j D_j * \\mu_{k,j} \\label{eq6}\\] 4.2 Partial models The general cumulative effects assessment model can easily be broken down into partial models to explore simplified portions of the assessment. We therefore present three additional indicators allowing the results of the assessment to be explored. 4.2.1 Cumulative stressors and hotspots Considering only the spatial distribution and relative intensity of the environmental stressors considered (\\(S_j\\)) provides an assessment of the cumulative stressors \\(E_{S,x}\\) (Beauchesne et al., 2020), which corresponds to the total of all the environmental stressors \\(S\\) in each cell \\(x\\) considered for the assessment: \\[E_{S_x} = \\sum_{j=1}^m S_{j,x} \\label{eq2}\\] The cumulative stressor assessment of environmental stressors identifies the sites that are most exposed to the potential effects of the environmental stressors considered for the cumulative effects assessment. It does not provide an effects assessment, since it only considers the stressors, and their intensity and distribution. However, it does allow us to assess the environments that are most likely to be affected by the stressors in our study area. In order to limit an over-representation of stressors composed of several subcategories, it is also possible to normalize the intensity values of a stressor category by the number of sub-categories that compose it. For example, a stressor consisting of 10 categories would have a higher weight than a stressor consisting of only one category. To normalize the intensity values, the intensity of these subcategories need only be divided by the number of subcategories, e.g. for a category composed of 10 subcategories, the intensity is divided by 10. Using the cumulative stressor assessment, it is also possible to obtain an assessment of cumulative stressor hotspots, which identify environments where environmental stressors co-occur at high relative intensities (Beauchesne et al., 2020). The cumulative hotspots \\(E_{H_x}\\) is calculated in each cell of the study grid and corresponds to the sum of stressors whose intensity is contained in their respective \\(80th\\) percentile: \\[E_{H_x} = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\mathbb{1} (S_{j,x} \\; \\epsilon \\; P_{80, S_j})\\] where \\(P_{80, S_j}\\) is the \\(80th\\) percentile of stressor \\(j\\). The results of normalized and non-normalized cumulative stressors and cumulative hotspots are presented in section ??. 4.2.1.1 Cumulative valued components Considering only the mapped presence or absence of the valued components considered (\\(CV_i\\)) provides an assessment of the cumulative stressors \\(E_{S,x}\\), which corresponds to the total of all environmental stressors \\(CV\\) in each cell \\(x\\): \\[E_{CV_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n CV_{i,x} \\label{eq3}\\] The cumulative footprint assessment identifies the environments with the highest content of valued components. As with the cumulative stressor assessment, it does not provide an effects assessment, since it only considers the valued components. However, it does allow us to assess the environments that are most important for the valued components in our study area. The presence of valued components can also be normalized by the number of valued component categories to avoid over-representation of valued components composed of multiple categories (see section 4.2.1). The results of normalized and non-normalized valued components are presented in section ??. 4.2.1.2 Cumulative exposure The intersection of the assessment of the stressors and the cumulative valued components provide the third partial model that we are presenting in addition to the overall model, i.e. cumulative exposure. The cumulative exposure \\(E_{E,x}\\) is the product of the intensity of the environmental stressors \\(S_{j,x}\\) and the presence of the valued components \\(CV_{i,x}\\) in each cell \\(x\\): \\[E_{E_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^m CV_{i,x} * S_{j,x} \\label{eq4}\\] Cumulative exposure provides an assessment of environments where there is greater overlap of valued components and environmental stressors. Although this metric does not predict the effect of stressors on valued components, it does identify environments where the valued components are most likely to be subjected to the effects of the environmental stressors considered. Cumulative exposure also makes it possible to delimit all the environments where cumulative effects could occur, since stressors and valued components must overlap in order to detect an effect; as such, this metric captures a significant portion of cumulative effects even though it does not incorporate the vulnerability of valued components to stressors. As with the cumulative valued components and stressors, cumulative exposure can be normalized by the number of stressor and valued component categories to avoid over-representation of valued components composed of multiple categories (see section 4.2.1). The results of normalized and non-normalized cumulative exposure are presented in section ??. 4.3 Data requirements Modules {#modules} Assessing cumulative using the described general models requires 5 independent data modules: Stressors Species distribution Metaweb Species-specific sensitivity Trophic sensitivity "],["nceadfo.html", "5 Reproducibility and data management", " 5 Reproducibility and data management "],["modules.html", "6 Modules 6.1 Environmental drivers 6.2 Species 6.3 Metaweb 6.4 Species-specific sensitivity 6.5 Trophic sensitivity", " 6 Modules 6.1 Environmental drivers We characterized the distribution and intensity of 17 environmental drivers on the Scotian Shelf during two distinct periods, i.e. 2010 to 2015 and 2016 to 2021. Temporal data was unavailable for certain drivers; in such instances, we used the same data for both periods (e.g. shipping). Drivers are divided in 4 groups: climate (n = 4), land-based / coastal (n = 6), fisheries (n = 5) and marine traffic (n = 2; Table 6.1). Drivers were log-transformed to avoid underestimating intermediate intensity values. All drivers were also scaled between 0 and 1 to obtain relative intensities and allow driver comparisons. Scaling was performed using the 99th quantile of intensity distribution as the upper bound to control for extreme values. For more details, see Beauchesne et al. (2020) and Halpern et al. (2019). The following subsections describes the approach used to evaluate the distribution and the intensity of each driver considered for the cumulative effects assessment.

(2021)] from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). A full description of the data and methods can be found in Galbraith et al. (2021), and we used a similar approach to that described by Beauchesne et al. (2020) to evaluate positive and negative temperature anomalies. Here, we provide a brief summary of the approach. The surface layer is characterized using sea surface-water temperature (SST) monthly composites from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). Images used are from DFO’s Maurice Lamontagne Institute at a 1 km resolution from 1985-2013 and from DFO’s Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO) Operational Remote Sensing group at a 1.5 km resolution since 2014. Monthly anomalies were constructed as the difference between monthly averages and the 1985-2010 climatological mean for each month. We used temperature anomalies, i.e. deviations from long-term normal conditions between 1985 and 2010, to evaluate an annual index of stress associated with extreme temperatures between 2010 and 2021. Temperature anomalies were calculated using the difference between grid cell values with 1985-2010 climatological averages. Anomaly time series were normalized by their standard deviation (SD) to allow comparisons between areas with different temperature ranges. Grid cells whose monthly value exceeded ±0.5 standard deviation (SD) from the long-term average were considered as anomalous (Galbraith et al., 2021). Outliers in the data were defined as those that fell beyond the interquartile range * 3, identified as extreme outliers by Tukey (1977). Outlier values were capped to correspond to the 5th and 95th percentile values. Anomalies were divided into positive and negative anomalies and the absolute value of anomalies were used as the intensity of the surface-water temperature anomalies in a given cell. Only the months of May to November were included to avoid biases associated with the presence of ice cover. The sum of anomalies between 2010 and 2015, and between 2016 and 2021, were used to obtain a single value per cell per period considered for the assessment. The anomalies were then resampled on the study grid used for this assessment. 6.1.1.2 Sea bottom temperature anomalies The data used to characterize bottom-water temperature anomalies come from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’ (DFO) temperature data from the summer groundfish survey on the Scotian Shelf. Bottom-water temperatures are interpolated from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sampling performed annually at a 0.2 degrees resolution (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2022). Anomalies are evaluated as a cell value for a given year minus that cell’s value from a climatology spanning YYYY to YYYY. Anomalies were divided into positive and negative anomalies and the absolute value of anomalies were used as the intensity of the surface-water temperature anomalies in a given cell. Grid cells that exceeded 0.5 were considered as anomalous for this assessment. The mean anomaly intensity between 2010 and 2015, and between 2016 and 2019, for each grid cell was used to generate the final index of bottom-water temperature anomalies for each period considered. 6.1.2 Coastal 6.1.2.1 Coastal development We used lights at night as a proxy of the presence of coastal infrastructure development, as stable lights mostly capture human settlements and industrial sites. We used data from the Nighttime Lights Time Series. Nighttime light products are compiled by the Earth Observation Group at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). They use globally available nighttime data obtained from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) to characterize global average radiance (\\(nanoWatts\\) \\(cm^{-2}\\) \\(sr^{-1}\\)) composite images at a 15 arc-second (~200 m) resolution.v We used the annual Version 2 Nighttime VIIRS DNB composites between 2012 and 2021 (Elvidge et al., 2021) to characterize coastal development in coastal areas of the Scotiain Shelf. As the effects of coastal development are likely acute in its direct vicinity, we extracted average radiance values using a 2 km buffer around grid cells within 2 km of the coast. In each grid cell, we used the mean annual radiance as a proxy of the effects of coastal development in coastal areas. The first period (2010-2015) only contains 4 years of data, since radiance values are unavailable prior to 2012. 6.1.2.2 Direct human impact We used the sum of coastal populations as a proxy of direct human impact in coastal areas of the Scotian Shelf. We used Statistics Canada dissemination area and associated population counts from the 2016 (Canada, 2016a, 2016b, 2017) and 2021 (Canada, 2022a, 2022b, 2022c) censuses to evaluated the population size in coastal areas. Dissemination areas are the smallest standard geographic area in which census data are disseminated. They combine to cover all of Canada and are highly variable in shapes and sizes. The census provides population count within the boundary of each dissemination area, which we used to evaluate total coastal population. As the effects of direct human impacts are likely acute mostly in coastal areas we calculated total population in grid cells within 2 km of the coast. Total population was measured in a 10 km buffer around each coastal cell. The total population in each buffer was the sum of intersecting dissemination areas divided by the intersection area between buffers and dissemination areas: \\[DHI_j = \\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} P_k * \\frac{A_{j,k}}{A{tot, k}}\\] where \\(j\\) is a buffered grid cell, \\(k\\) is a dissemination area intersecting \\(j\\), \\(P\\) is the population in \\(k\\), \\(A\\) is the area of the \\(k\\) overlapping with \\(j\\) and \\(A_{tot}\\) is the total area of \\(k\\). This approach was favoured to reduce the effects of very large dissemination areas overlapping with buffers on a very small percentage of their total area. We used the mean values from the 2016 and 2021 census for both periods of the assessment, as we did not have the data for the period between 2010 and 2015. 6.1.2.3 Land-based drivers The data used to characterize the intensity of inorganic pollution, organic pollution, population density and nutrient input in coastal areas come from an atlas of land use for coastal watershed in the Maritimes Region, hereafter the Land Use Atlas (Guijarro-Sabaniel and Kelly, 2022). We provide a brief summary of data and methods in this document. For more details, refer to Guijarro-Sabaniel and Kelly (2022). Coastal watershed boundaries in the Scotian Shelf Biogeographic Marine Management Sub-region were delineated using a digital elevation model (DEM) for each province was combined with national hydrographic data and calculating the flow direction and accumulation for each DEM. Stream orders for the stream network were then evaluated to locate the highest flow accumulation value for each watershed and given a value between 1 (lowest) and 4 (highest). The locations of these values were then used to identify pour points (e.g. river mouths) along the coast for each watershed. Spread of land stressors into coastal and marine environments was then modeled using a diffusive plume model using a density decay buffer based on stream order of the main pour points. The following sections describes how this model was used to characterize the intensity of inorganic pollution, nutrient input, organic pollution and population density in coastal areas of the Scotian Shelf. 6.1.2.3.1 Inorganic pollution The intensity of inorganic pollution was modelled using the percent area covered by impervious surfaces in each watershed. Impervious surfaces refer to articifial structures such as roads and parking lots and industrial areas such as ports that are covered by water-resistan materials. Impervious surfaces are used as a proxy of inorganic pollution under the assumption that most of this pollution comes from urban runoff. Impervious surfaces were identified in watershed using a combination of multiple datasets from the provinces New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Refer to the Land cover section and Table 1 of the Material and Methods in Guijarro-Sabaniel and Kelly (2022) for more details. 6.1.2.3.2 Organic pollution We used the percent cover of agriculture land use in each watershed as a proxy of the intensity organic pollution in each watershed. The percent area covered by agricultural land in each watershed was identified in watershed using a combination of multiple datasets from the provinces New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Refer to the Land cover section and Table 1 of the Material and Methods in Guijarro-Sabaniel and Kelly (2022) for more details. 6.1.2.3.3 Population density This intensity of stress caused by watershed population in coastal areas was modelled using the population density in each watershed in \\(person * ha^{-1}\\). Total population was estimated as the number of civic address datasets from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia multiplied by the average number of residents per household (i.e. 2.3) obtained from Statistics Canada. Population density was then evaluated as the total population in a watershed divided by the watershed area in hectares. 6.1.2.3.4 Nutrient input We used data from Kelly et al. (2021) to obtain the intensity of nutrient input in coastal areas of the Scotian Shelf. Kelly et al. (2021) used data from the Land Use Atlas to estimate nitrogen loading in coastal areas with the Nitrogen Loading Model (NLM) framework (McIver et al., 2015; Nagel et al., 2018; Valiela et al., 1997; Valiela et al., 2000) to estimate total (dissolved) nitrogen from point and non-point source inputs in coastal areas from atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use, and wastewater disposal. Data and methods used to apply the NLM framework are described in details in Kelly et al. (2021). 6.1.3 Fisheries The intensity and distribution of commercial fisheries on the Scotian Shelf was assessed using the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’s logbook program (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2021); these logbooks provide a thorough, if not exhaustive, overview of fisheries in eastern Canada. We used data between 2010 and 2021 to characterize the distribution and the intensity of commercial fisheries on the Scotian Shelf. This period was characterized by 2986667 fishing activities targeting 80 species and a total of 111 species were captured when considering bycatch. Fishing activities are performed using a variety of gear types (e.g. trap, trawl, dredge, driftnet, hand line, longline, scuba diving, purse seine, seine, beach seine and jig fishing), which can have different effects on species and habitats. Fisheries activities were therefore divided based on the type of environmental effects attributed to specific gear types according to the categories suggested by Halpern et al. (2008) and used by Beauchesne et al. (2020) for the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (Tables 6.2 and 6.3): demersal, destructive, high bycatch (DD) demersal, non-destructive, high bycatch (DNH) demersal, non-destructive, low bycatch (DNL) pelagic, high bycatch (PHB) pelagic, low bycatch (PLB) Gear types can be further classified into fixed or mobile gear (Table 6.3). We used the type of mobility to evaluate an expected area of effect for each fishing event, using radii of 200 and 2000 meters for fixed and mobile gear types, respectively (Beauchesne et al., 2020). This approach, while decreasing precision, considers the potential uncertainty associated with fishing activity coordinates, gear mobility, and the absence of start and end coordinates for mobile gear. Table 6.2: Description of commercial fishing catagories used to characterize the intensity and distribution of fisheries on the Scotian Shelf. Accronym Category Description DD Demersal, destructive, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear that may damage habitats or substrate, e.g. trawling and dragging. DNL Demersal, non-destructive, low-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear with little or no bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., deep-sea fishing. DNH Demersal, non-destructive, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear with high bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., trap and seine. PLB Pelagic, low-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using pelagic fishing gear with little or no bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., line fishing, purse seine. PHB Pelagic, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using pelagic fishing gear with high bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., gillnet and longline. Table 6.3: Classification of gear types based on their environmental effects and mobility. DD: demersal, destructive, high bycatch; DNH: demersal, non-destructive, high bycatch; DNL: demersal, non-destructive, low bycatch; PHB: pelagic, high bycatch; PLB: pelagic, low bycatch. Adapted from Beauchesne et al. (2020). Type of gear Category Mobility Trap DNH Fixed Bottom trawl DD Mobile Drag DD Mobile Gillnet PHB Fixed Line fishing PLB Fixed Longline PHB Fixed Diving DNL Fixed Purse seine PLB Fixed Danish or Scottish seine DNH Fixed Shoreline seine DNH Fixed Trap DNH Fixed Jigger PLB Fixed To characterize the intensity of fishing activities, we used a biomass yield density index by summing the total annual biomass captured in each grid cell covering the Scotian Shelf, yielding an assessment in kg per cell surface, i.e. \\(kg * km^{-2}\\) in this case. For each period considered in the assessment (2010-2015 and 2016-2021) and each fishing category, we used the mean annual biomass captured per grid cell to capture the intensity and distribution of as the assessment of the intensity and distribution of fisheries on the Scotian Shelf. 6.1.4 Marine traffic 6.1.4.1 Shipping The data used to characterize shipping come the Global Fishing Watch, which provides shipping data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data globally. We obtained data between 2017 and 2020 that characterize monthly commercial shipping (e.g. cargo, reefer, tanker, bunker) as rasters with a 0.1 degree resolution, either as the number of vessels or the total hours of vessel presence in each grid cell (Global Fishing Watch, 2022). The data was also available either as direct observations from the AIS data, or interpolated to a regular interval of five minutes between points. We used the sum of monthly interpolated number of all vessel types in each grid cell to obtain an assessment of annual shipping intensity on the Scotian Shelf. When then resampled the 0.1 degree resolution grid to our own study grid. We used the mean annual shipping intensity value between 2017 and 2020 for both periods considered in the assessment. 6.2 Species The assessment considers 172 marine, 8 marine mammal, and 25 sea bird taxa, for a total of 205 taxa considered. We also assumed that phytoplankton and zooplankton species were present throughout the St. Lawrence System since these taxa are missing from our dataset and are required to properly consider trophic dynamics. The following sections describe the data and approaches used to evaluate their distribution on the Scotian Shelf 6.2.1 Marine species 6.2.1.1 Biotic data We used taxa occurrence data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DF) ecosystem spring (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2020b), summer (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2020c), and 4vsw (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2020a) surveys. These surveys collect data to monitor the distriution and abundance of fish and invertebrates through the Scotian Shelf, Bay of Fundy and Georges Bank. We formatted the list of taxa considered for the analyses gy combining and removing taxa based on expert knowledge and bibliographic research (e.g. species of the same genus and hard to distinguish in situ were combined). Only taxa with at least 50 observations were considered for the assessment. This process yielded NA occurrences and 556191 absences for 172 on the Scotial Shelf (Table 6.4). All species scientific names were resolved using the taxize R package (Chamberlain et al., 2019; Chamberlain and Szöcs, 2013). Table 6.4: List of marine species obtained through Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DF) ecosystem spring (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2020b), summer (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2020c), and 4vsw (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2020a) surveys on the Scotian Shelf, Bay of Fundy and Goerges Bank.

the bottom-water and surface-water conditions on the Scotian Shelf using data from Bio-ORACLE, which provides geophysical, biotic and environmental data layers for surface and benthic marine environments (Assis et al., 2018; Bosch and Fernandez, 2022; Tyberghein et al., 2012), the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) offering a global terrain model for ocean and land, providing elevation data, in meters, on a 15 arc-second interval grid (Group, 2021), and the Bedford Institute of Oceanography North Atlantic Model (BNAM) averaged over the 1990 to 2015 period for monthly temperatures and salinities at the bottome and at the surface (Wang et al., 2018a, 2018c, 2018b).

(2018b) 6.2.1.3 Taxa distribution We evaluated the distribution of taxa on the Scotian Shelf using the Random Forest ensemble learner (Breiman, 2001). We used the default parameters of the randomForest R package to classify the presence or absence of taxa: 500 trees and the number of variables in the random subset at each node set to the square root of the number of variables (Liaw and Wiener, 2002). All 23 abiotic variables (Table (tab:abiotic)) were used to model the distribution of species. The performance of each modell was evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and True Skilled Statistics [TSS; Table (tab:spnm); Allouche et al. (2006)]. We predicted the spatial distribution of all taxa within the grid of our area of interest and performed a smoothing of predictions using a bisquare kernel smoothing approach (Dos Santos et al., 2018) with a 5 km radius to avoid granular distributions; this is done that affect the assessment of species co-occurrences ncecessary for the subsequent network-scale cumualtive effects assessment. A threshold of 0.5 was used to transform continuous predictions to binary distributions, identifying areas where taxa are most likely to be found. 6.2.2 Marine mammals The distribution fo marine mammals in the area of interest comes from the second edition of a guidebook published for mariners who frequent the Northwest Atlantic (Le WWF-Canada et le R’eseau d’observation de mammif‘eres marins, 2021a). The purpose of this guide is to inform mariners on the problem of collisions between vessels and whales, how to minimize such incidents, the various species of whales and leatherback turtles in the area and where they might be present, and on areas where heightened vigilance is required. Nine species of marine mammals were selected for this guide based on their conservation status and their known risk of collision with vessels (Le WWF-Canada et le R’eseau d’observation de mammif‘eres marins, 2021a, 2021b). The distribution of each marine mammal was assessed throught the integration of 14 datasets from scientific and opportunistic surveys between 2010-2015 (Table 6.6; Le WWF-Canada et le R’eseau d’observation de mammif‘eres marins (2021c)). The area of interest covered by the guide covers the geographic boundaries of \\(40^o\\) to \\(55^o\\) N and -72\\(^o\\) to -48\\(^o\\) W. The area of interest was divided into a regular 0.05\\(^o\\) x 0.05\\(^o\\) grid and the number of sightings recorded in the 14 available databases was calculated for each species considered. A Gaussian smoothing – i.e. an interpolation method based on a normal distribution – of 0.2\\(^o\\) was then applied to the grid. Values in each grid cells were then normalized by the total number of sightings for a species and log-transformed to minimize the effect of extreme values. The caveats that accompany these maps in the guide and are reported verbatim in this report: Sighting effort was not quantified and varies considerably in time and space. The data represent the relative occurrence of reported sightings rather than the actual density or abundance of the species. The quality of some of the sighting data is unknown. Sightings are reported from individuals with varying degrees of expertise in identifying marine mammals.

For our study, we resampled the distributional maps available in the guide to integrate them into our own grid. The values were then normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing each value by the maximum value observed within the grid for each species. The resulting values can be interpreted as the relative density of marine mammal sightings, with values of 0 representing a low relative density and a value of 1 a high relative density. All cells with values greater than 0 were used to identify the binary distribution of marine mammals.

All sightings of individual bird species or bird groups from the vessel and aerial surveys between 2006 and 2022 were combined to evaluate the distribution of birds in the area of interest. A total of 25 bird species / groups were obtained (Table 6.8).

The area of interest was divided into a regular 0.05\\(^o\\) x 0.05\\(^o\\) degrees grid. For each species or species group, the number of sightings recorded in the ECSAS database was evaluated in each grid cell. A Gaussian smoothing - i.e. an interpolation method based on a normal distribution - of 20 \\(km\\) was then applied to the grid. A log transformation was then applied to minimize the effect of extreme values on the resulting maps. Cell values were then normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing by the maximum value observed for each bird across the area of interest. All cells with values greater than 0 were used to identify the binary distribution of sea birds. 6.3 Metaweb We predicted the metaweb of the Scotian Shelf, i.e. the network of biotic interactions, using a recommender approach (Beauchesne et al., 2016). Here, we provide a brief overview of the approach, but refer to Beauchesne et al. (2016) for more details. The approach is built on a series of ligical steps that predict a candidate resource list for each taxon considered based on empirically observed interactions and on the similarity between consumers and resources. It uses the K-nearest neighbour It predicts pairwise interactions given taxonomic and dietery similarity between taxa using the K-nearest neighbour algorithm [KNN; Murphy (2012)]. Predictions are informed by a catalogue of empirical interactions from all over the world (Beauchesne et al., 2016). The interactions catalogue was built using food web data (Brose et al., 2005; Kortsch et al., 2015; University of Canberra, 2016), predator-prey interactions (Barnes et al., 2008) and pairwise interactions from the GloBI database (Poelen et al., 2014; Poelen et al., 2019). We limited the compendium to taxa found in marine and coastal ecosystems. The original interaction catalogue was built for a cumulative effects assessment of global changes on the food web of the St. Lawrence System (Beauchesne, 2020). The interaction catalogue was updated for the assessment of the Scotian Shelf using the GloBI database. We used the taxonomic families from the list of species considered for the assessment to identify all member species of those families for which interactions were available on the GloBI dataset using the rglobi package (Poelen et al., 2019). We then combined the original interaction catalogue with the interactions extracted from GloBI to form a new catalogue of biotic interactions. This process yielded a total of 183 625 pairwise interactions between 14 870 taxa to inform interaction predictions. Taxa similarity was evaluated from taxonomic classification and sets of consumers or resources using the Tanimoto similarity measure. A weight of 0.5 was given to taxonomy and consumers or resources to consider them simultaneously (Desjardins-Proulx et al., 2016). The taxonomy of all taxa considered was accessed and validated from WoRMS (WoRMS Editorial Board, 2017) using the taxize package (Chamberlain et al., 2019; Chamberlain and Szöcs, 2013). We included the main phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa found in the St. Lawrence System to predict the metaweb (Morissette et al., 2003; Savenkoff et al., 2004; Savenkoff, 2012); we then grouped predictions under phytoplankton or zooplankton. This yielded a total of 772 taxa (\\(S\\)) for which we predicted a metaweb structured by 18 021 links (\\(L\\)), a link density (\\(L_{moy} = L/S\\)) of 23.34 and a connectance (\\(C = L/S^2\\)) of 0.03, which is within range of most reported food webs (Dunne et al., 2002). 6.4 Species-specific sensitivity We evaluated the relative species-specific sensitivity of all 205 taxa considered in the assessment to each stressor using a trait-matching approach, as in Beauchesne (2020). For each driver considered, Beauchesne (2020) identified traits that were known or suspected to influence the sensitivity of a species to the direct effects of that particular driver. For instance, the feeding strategy of on an organism can affect its sensitivity to certain stressors. Traits were categorized to reflect their relative contribution to the sensitivity of a taxa to the effects of a stressor and allow for a comparison between taxa. For example, suspension feeders are generally more affected by nutrients and metals than deposit feeders (Ellis et al., 2017). Beauchesne (2020) documented the body composition, the maximal body size, the type of marine environment in which species are found, the feeding mode, the mobility and the phylum of 391 taxa from the St. Lawrence. Traits data were extracted from the World Register of Marine Species [WoRMS; WoRMS Editorial Board (2017)], FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2019), SeaLifeBase (Palomares and Pauly, 2019), the Encyclopedia of Life [EoL; Encyclopedia of Life (2020)] and the Global Biotic Interaction (GloBI) database (Poelen et al., 2014; Poelen et al., 2019). We used the taxize (Chamberlain et al., 2019; Chamberlain and Szöcs, 2013), worrms (Chamberlain, 2020) and rfishbase (Boettiger et al., 2012) R packages to extract traits data. Manual searches, mainly on the WoRMS and EoL web portals, were performed and documented when programatic extractions were unavailable. The traits dataset from Beauchesne (2020) was updated for this assessment by using the same approach and resources to consider species of the Scotian Shelf, and to include species of marine mammals and sea birds that were not considered in Beauchesne (2020) (Table 6.9). Species that were targeted or caught as bycatch on the Scotian Shelf were also identified using the fisheries logbook data from DFO (Fisheries and ceans Canada, 2021). The code associated with traits extraction is available at https://github.com/Ecosystem-Assessments/Species_Traits. For each trait and taxa combination, traits were given a weight between 0 and 1 to reflect the relative contribution of that trait to a species’ sensitivity to a stressor. A weight of 0 means that a taxa possessing that trait is insensitive to a stressor, whereas a weight of 1 means that that trait renders a taxa highly sensitive to the effect of a stressor. In instances when a taxa had more than one trait (e.g. crawler and swimmer), the trait with the maximal sensitivity weight was retained. The sensitivity assessment was informed by expert knowledge and bibliographic research. Trait-matching rules and weights for each trait-stressor combination are available in Table 6.10. The relative sensitivity of each taxon was evaluated as the product of the weight given to all traits considered to assess the sensitivity of a given stressor. This process yielded a relative sensitivity assessment ranging between 0 and 1. The code to evaluate the relative sensitivity of taxa on the Scotian Shelf is available at https://github.com/Ecosystem-Assessments/Species_direct_sensitivity.

(2021). Here, we provide a brief description of the approach; a full description is available in those works. Beauchesne et al. (2021) developed a theoretical framework to evaluate a species’ sensitivity to multiple stressors as a function of its trophic position, which we refer to as a species’ trophic sensitivity. Beauchesne et al. (2021) simulated stressors on the most empirically abundant 3-species motifs — i.e. tri-trophic food chain, omnivory, exploitative competition and apparent competition – using Lotka-Volterra models (Gellner and McCann, 2016). Negative effects of environmental pressures were simulated using combinations of equilibria equation parameters for resource growth, mortality, attack and conversion rates; these represent effects to ecological processes and their combination are the pathways through which environmental drivers affect species directly and indirectly through their ecological interactions. All possible pathways of effects – i.e. all combinations of ecological processes – were simulated for each 3-species motif considered. The difference between equilibrium population abundance before and after simulations was used as a proxy of a species’ trophic sensitivity; This represents the net effects of stressors on species and integrates all direct effects to a species, and all indirect effects propagating through it’s interactions with other speies (Abrams et al., 1996; Beauchesne et al., 2021). To evaluate a species’ trophic sensitivity empirically, Beauchesne et al. (2020) used simulation results from Beauchesne et al. (2021) as heuristics to infer a species’ anticipated trophic sensitivity to the effects of environmental drivers as a function its position in the ecological network of the Scotian Shelf. Beauchesne et al. (2020) used the absolute values of simulated trophic sensitivities and considered that any effect to a species’ population dynamics, whether negative or positive, can propagate and disturb the dynamics of an ecological community. Pathways of effect were also simplified to consider only effects to population density for ease of evaluation empirically, as effects to ecological processes such as attack and conversion rates are inhrently challenging to evaluate empirically, especially for many species simultaneously. Simplfied pathways were then averaged to obtain a single value of trophic sensitivity per pathway of effect. This resulted in 124 possible trophic sensitivity values based on the position and types of ecological interactions in which a species is involved. All trophic sensitivities were scaled between 0 and 1 for the analyses. Refer to Beauchesne (2020) and Beauchesne et al. (2021) for more details, and to the description of the network-scale assessment model for a description of how trophic sensitivity values are used in the assessment of the cumulative effects of global changes on the food webs of the Scotian Shelf.
