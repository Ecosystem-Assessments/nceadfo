The scientific and grey[^grey] literature thus abounds with publications providing definitions, implementation frameworks, best practices guides, and guiding principles for cumulative effects assessments in environmental impact assessments (e.g. peterson1987?; hegmann1999?; krausman2011?). Therefore, a wide variety of definitions and approaches exists (see therivel2007?; duinker2013?). In its broadest sense, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (conseilcanadiendesministresdelenvironnement2014?) defines cumulative effects as a “change in the environment caused by multiple interactions among human activities and natural processes that accumulate across space and time.”* Cumulative effects assessment is defined as “a systematic process of identifying, analyzing and evaluating cumulative effects”*. These definitions point to the systematic nature of cumulative effects and their assessment, i.e., management of ecosystems and the interactions that structure them as a whole, including human aspects, as related to ecosystem-based management (christensen1996?; rosenberg2005?; leslie2007?). However, cumulative effects are defined in more restrictive terms in policy, legislative, and regulatory texts (jones2016?). The 1992 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act defines cumulative effects as follows: “[…] the cumulative environmental effects [of a project] that are likely to result from the project in combination with other projects or activities”. Cumulative effects assessment processes are thus typically conducted from a project perspective rather than a systemic perspective. A number of scientists thus call for the use of regional approaches to the cumulative effects assessment (e.g. dube2003?; duinker2006?; jones2016?; sinclair2017?). Moreover, Canada’s Minister of the Environment and Climate Change recently authorized a regional assessment of the St. Lawrence River area on July 15, 2021, in response to a request by the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawà:ke under the Impact Assessment Act. According to (sinclair2017?), a regional cumulative effects assessment can be defined as follows: ”[A Regional Effects Assessment (REA)] is an [environmental assessment] whose primary or sole defining feature is its regional scope and its focus on understanding the interactions between human activities and the natural world. This means that in just about all aspects other than its spatial limitations, an REA should be comprehensive and integrated.” Similar to a project-based approach within environmental impact assessments, the regional approach focuses instead on the total effects (effect-based) and viability of environmental receptors of interest, commonly referred to as valued components (beanlands1983?; sinclair2017?). Several constraints limit its practical application, especially the need to use environmental measures – e.g. variation in the mortality rate of a species as a function of an environmental stressor – to establish the effects of one or more stressors on a valued component. These types of measures are particularly difficult to obtain in cumulative effects assessments; they also necessarily make assessments reactive since effects must be observed in order to establish a meaningful link between the presence of a stressor and the degradation of a valued component (dube2003?). An ideal approach would instead make it possible to combine effects-based and stressor-based cumulative effects assessment approaches (dube2003?; sinclair2017?). "],["method.html", "4 Assessment method 4.1 General models 4.2 Partial models 4.3 Data requirements", " 4 Assessment method A study by (halpern2008a?) took a major step toward a systemic and spatially explicit assessment of the cumulative effects of human activities on the world’s oceans by assessing the cumulative effects of 17 environmental stressors on 20 types of marine ecosystems. This study showed that few environments remain unmarked by human activities and that most ecosystems are affected by multiple environmental stressors. The updates published by the same group in 2015 (halpern2015a?) and 2019 (halpern2019?) also show that cumulative effects on the oceans are increasing globally. In addition to being used worldwide, this method has been used many times in different regions of the globe to characterize cumulative effects, including in California (halpern2009?), the Arctic (andersen2015?; afflerbach2017?), and the Canadian Pacific Ocean (ban2010?; clarkemurray2015?; clarkemurray2015a?; singh2020?). At the time of writing, an assessment using a similar approach is underway for the Placentia Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador pilot area as part of Transport Canada’s national initiative Cumulative Effects of Marine Shipping. Fisheries and Oceans Canada is also conducting an assessment for the Maritimes Region and is investigating the general applicability of the approach to characterize cumulative effects on Canadian oceans. 4.1 General models 4.1.1 Species-scale assessment The method developed by (halpern2008a?) allows for the combination of the diversity of valued components, stressors, and vulnerability of each valued component to each stressor. The method requires three types of data: 1) the mapped presence or absence of the valued components (\\(CV_i\\)), 2) the spatial distribution and relative intensity (i.e. normalized between 0 and 1) of the environmental stressors considered (\\(S_j\\)), and 3) the relative vulnerability of each valued component to each stressor (\\(\\mu_{i,j}\\)) These data are then incorporated into a grid made up of cells of homogeneous size characterizing the study area. Cumulative effect predictions (\\(E_C\\)) are calculated for each cell (\\(x\\)) of the grid by summing up all individual stressor effects over the set of valued components: \\[E_{C_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^m CV_{i,x} * S_{j,x} * \\mu_{i,j} \\label{eq1}\\] This method proposes the calculation of a relative indicator of cumulative effects to predict the risks associated with the effects of multiple environmental stressors on valued components. The term “relative” is central to understanding the proposed assessment method. An absolute indicator would identify a change in the state of valued components resulting from cumulative environmental stressors, such as a decline in the beluga whale population in the St. Lawrence Estuary in response to cumulative environmental stressors. A relative indicator would instead allow for a comparison of the various environmental stressors according to their intensity within the region studied and their effects on the valued components. The results must therefore be interpreted as a probability of risk of the marine vessel activities to the valued components considered. The results of the cumulative effects assessment using this approach are presented in section ?? of the report. The calculated cumulative effects predictions can be broken down to assess the relative share of the effects of a single or multiple stressors on one or more valued components (Figure 4.1). For example, predictions of cumulative effects could be broken down to explore cumulative effects on all marine mammals, on a single species, or to identify regions where marine mammals are most at risk in the study area. A complete exploration of all stressor-valued component combinations is possible (Figure 4.1); this offers the ability to analyze different management scenarios and lead to clear and focused recommendations in order to optimize and prioritize management efforts in a region of interest (halpern2015a?). It also offers a flexible and quantitative approach that can integrate different types of data that are sometimes difficult to compare, such as biophysical data with qualitative knowledge (halpern2008a?; halpern2013?; halpern2015a?). Figure 4.1: A fictitious example of spatial assessment of cumulative effects using the methodology suggested by (halpern2008a?). The assessment begins by delineating a study area of interest (A). A picture of the study area is then made by characterizing the distribution of environmental stressors (B) and the valued components (C) allowing the assessment objectives to be reached. The summation of all the environmental stressors allows us to identify the environments that are most exposed to cumulative stress, i.e. cumulative exposure (D). The sum of valued components, on the other hand, allows us to identify the environments in the study area where a higher number of valued components overlap (E). By combining the distribution of environmental stressors and valued components along with the vulnerability of the valued components to the environmental stressors, a relative assessment of individual effects is obtained (F). It is possible to assess the impact of all the environmental stressors on a single valued component (G); similarly, it is possible to assess the impact of a single environmental stressor on all valued components (H). Finding the sum of all the individual impacts provides the relative assessment of cumulative effects incorporating all combinations of environmental stressors and valued components (I). 4.1.2 Network-scale assessment 4.2 Partial models The general cumulative effects assessment model can easily be broken down into partial models to explore simplified portions of the assessment. We therefore present three additional indicators allowing the results of the assessment to be explored. 4.2.1 Cumulative stressors and hotspots Considering only the spatial distribution and relative intensity of the environmental stressors considered (\\(S_j\\)) provides an assessment of the cumulative stressors \\(E_{S,x}\\) (beauchesne2020?), which corresponds to the total of all the environmental stressors \\(S\\) in each cell \\(x\\) considered for the assessment: \\[E_{S_x} = \\sum_{j=1}^m S_{j,x} \\label{eq2}\\] The cumulative stressor assessment of environmental stressors identifies the sites that are most exposed to the potential effects of the environmental stressors considered for the cumulative effects assessment. It does not provide an effects assessment, since it only considers the stressors, and their intensity and distribution. However, it does allow us to assess the environments that are most likely to be affected by the stressors in our study area. In order to limit an over-representation of stressors composed of several subcategories, it is also possible to normalize the intensity values of a stressor category by the number of sub-categories that compose it. For example, a stressor consisting of 10 categories would have a higher weight than a stressor consisting of only one category. To normalize the intensity values, the intensity of these subcategories need only be divided by the number of subcategories, e.g. for a category composed of 10 subcategories, the intensity is divided by 10. Using the cumulative stressor assessment, it is also possible to obtain an assessment of cumulative stressor hotspots, which identify environments where environmental stressors co-occur at high relative intensities (beauchesne2020?). The cumulative hotspots \\(E_{H_x}\\) is calculated in each cell of the study grid and corresponds to the sum of stressors whose intensity is contained in their respective \\(80th\\) percentile: \\[E_{H_x} = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\mathbb{1} (S_{j,x} \\; \\epsilon \\; P_{80, S_j})\\] where \\(P_{80, S_j}\\) is the \\(80th\\) percentile of stressor \\(j\\). The results of normalized and non-normalized cumulative stressors and cumulative hotspots are presented in section ??. 4.2.1.1 Cumulative valued components Considering only the mapped presence or absence of the valued components considered (\\(CV_i\\)) provides an assessment of the cumulative stressors \\(E_{S,x}\\), which corresponds to the total of all environmental stressors \\(CV\\) in each cell \\(x\\): \\[E_{CV_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n CV_{i,x} \\label{eq3}\\] The cumulative footprint assessment identifies the environments with the highest content of valued components. As with the cumulative stressor assessment, it does not provide an effects assessment, since it only considers the valued components. However, it does allow us to assess the environments that are most important for the valued components in our study area. The presence of valued components can also be normalized by the number of valued component categories to avoid over-representation of valued components composed of multiple categories (see section 4.2.1). The results of normalized and non-normalized valued components are presented in section ??. 4.2.1.2 Cumulative exposure The intersection of the assessment of the stressors and the cumulative valued components provide the third partial model that we are presenting in addition to the overall model, i.e. cumulative exposure. The cumulative exposure \\(E_{E,x}\\) is the product of the intensity of the environmental stressors \\(S_{j,x}\\) and the presence of the valued components \\(CV_{i,x}\\) in each cell \\(x\\): \\[E_{E_x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^m CV_{i,x} * S_{j,x} \\label{eq4}\\] Cumulative exposure provides an assessment of environments where there is greater overlap of valued components and environmental stressors. Although this metric does not predict the effect of stressors on valued components, it does identify environments where the valued components are most likely to be subjected to the effects of the environmental stressors considered. Cumulative exposure also makes it possible to delimit all the environments where cumulative effects could occur, since stressors and valued components must overlap in order to detect an effect; as such, this metric captures a significant portion of cumulative effects even though it does not incorporate the vulnerability of valued components to stressors. As with the cumulative valued components and stressors, cumulative exposure can be normalized by the number of stressor and valued component categories to avoid over-representation of valued components composed of multiple categories (see section 4.2.1). The results of normalized and non-normalized cumulative exposure are presented in section ??. 4.3 Data requirements Modules {#modules} Assessing cumulative using the described general models requires 5 independent data modules: Stressors Species distribution Metaweb Species-specific sensitivity Trophic sensitivity "],["nceadfo.html", "5 Reproducibility and data management", " 5 Reproducibility and data management "],["modules.html", "6 Modules 6.1 Environmental drivers 6.2 Species 6.3 Metaweb 6.4 Species-specific sensitivity 6.5 Trophic sensitivity", " 6 Modules 6.1 Environmental drivers We characterized the distribution and intensity of 17 environmental drivers on the Scotian Shelf during two distinct periods, i.e. 2010 to 2015 and 2016 to 2021. Temporal data was unavailable for certain drivers; in such instances, we used the same data for both periods (e.g. shipping). Drivers are divided in 4 groups: climate (n = 4), land-based / coastal (n = 6), fisheries (n = 5) and marine traffic (n = 2; Table 6.1). Drivers were log-transformed to avoid underestimating intermediate intensity values. All drivers were also scaled between 0 and 1 to obtain relative intensities and allow driver comparisons. Scaling was performed using the 99th quantile of intensity distribution as the upper bound to control for extreme values. For more details, see (beauchesne2020?) and (halpern2019?). The following subsections describes the approach used to evaluate the distribution and the intensity of each driver considered for the cumulative effects assessment. Table 6.1: List of environmental drivers considered for the cumulative effects assessment of global changes on the ecological communities of the Scotian Shelf.

A full description of the data and methods can be found in (galbraith2021?), and we used a similar approach to that described by (beauchesne2020?) to evaluate positive and negative temperature anomalies. Here, we provide a brief summary of the approach. The surface layer is characterized using sea surface-water temperature (SST) monthly composites from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). Images used are from DFO’s Maurice Lamontagne Institute at a 1 km resolution from 1985-2013 and from DFO’s Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO) Operational Remote Sensing group at a 1.5 km resolution since 2014. Monthly anomalies were constructed as the difference between monthly averages and the 1985-2010 climatological mean for each month. We used temperature anomalies, i.e. deviations from long-term normal conditions between 1985 and 2010, to evaluate an annual index of stress associated with extreme temperatures between 2010 and 2021. Temperature anomalies were calculated using the difference between grid cell values with 1985-2010 climatological averages. Anomaly time series were normalized by their standard deviation (SD) to allow comparisons between areas with different temperature ranges. Grid cells whose monthly value exceeded ±0.5 standard deviation (SD) from the long-term average were considered as anomalous (galbraith2021?). Outliers in the data were defined as those that fell beyond the interquartile range * 3, identified as extreme outliers by (tukey1977?). Outlier values were capped to correspond to the 5th and 95th percentile values. Anomalies were divided into positive and negative anomalies and the absolute value of anomalies were used as the intensity of the surface-water temperature anomalies in a given cell. Only the months of May to November were included to avoid biases associated with the presence of ice cover. The sum of anomalies between 2010 and 2015, and between 2016 and 2021, were used to obtain a single value per cell per period considered for the assessment. The anomalies were then resampled on the study grid used for this assessment. 6.1.1.2 Sea bottom temperature anomalies The data used to characterize bottom-water temperature anomalies come from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’ (DFO) temperature data from the summer groundfish survey on the Scotian Shelf. Bottom-water temperatures are interpolated from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sampling performed annually at a 0.2 degrees resolution (dfo2022a?). Anomalies are evaluated as a cell value for a given year minus that cell’s value from a climatology spanning YYYY to YYYY. Anomalies were divided into positive and negative anomalies and the absolute value of anomalies were used as the intensity of the surface-water temperature anomalies in a given cell. Grid cells that exceeded 0.5 were considered as anomalous for this assessment. The mean anomaly intensity between 2010 and 2015, and between 2016 and 2019, for each grid cell was used to generate the final index of bottom-water temperature anomalies for each period considered. 6.1.2 Coastal 6.1.2.1 Coastal development We used lights at night as a proxy of the presence of coastal infrastructure development, as stable lights mostly capture human settlements and industrial sites. We used data from the Nighttime Lights Time Series. Nighttime light products are compiled by the Earth Observation Group at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). They use globally available nighttime data obtained from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) to characterize global average radiance (\\(nanoWatts\\) \\(cm^{-2}\\) \\(sr^{-1}\\)) composite images at a 15 arc-second (~200 m) resolution.v We used the annual Version 2 Nighttime VIIRS DNB composites between 2012 and 2021 (elvidge2021?) to characterize coastal development in coastal areas of the Scotiain Shelf. As the effects of coastal development are likely acute in its direct vicinity, we extracted average radiance values using a 2 km buffer around grid cells within 2 km of the coast. In each grid cell, we used the mean annual radiance as a proxy of the effects of coastal development in coastal areas. The first period (2010-2015) only contains 4 years of data, since radiance values are unavailable prior to 2012. 6.1.2.2 Direct human impact We used the sum of coastal populations as a proxy of direct human impact in coastal areas of the Scotian Shelf. We used Statistics Canada dissemination area and associated population counts from the 2016 (statisticscanada2016a?; statisticscanada2016b?; statisticscanada2017?) and 2021 (statisticscanada2022?; statisticscanada2022a?; statisticscanada2022b?) censuses to evaluated the population size in coastal areas. Dissemination areas are the smallest standard geographic area in which census data are disseminated. They combine to cover all of Canada and are highly variable in shapes and sizes. The census provides population count within the boundary of each dissemination area, which we used to evaluate total coastal population. As the effects of direct human impacts are likely acute mostly in coastal areas we calculated total population in grid cells within 2 km of the coast. Total population was measured in a 10 km buffer around each coastal cell. The total population in each buffer was the sum of intersecting dissemination areas divided by the intersection area between buffers and dissemination areas: \\[DHI_j = \\sum_{k=1}^{n_j} P_k * \\frac{A_{j,k}}{A{tot, k}}\\] where \\(j\\) is a buffered grid cell, \\(k\\) is a dissemination area intersecting \\(j\\), \\(P\\) is the population in \\(k\\), \\(A\\) is the area of the \\(k\\) overlapping with \\(j\\) and \\(A_{tot}\\) is the total area of \\(k\\). This approach was favoured to reduce the effects of very large dissemination areas overlapping with buffers on a very small percentage of their total area. We used the mean values from the 2016 and 2021 census for both periods of the assessment, as we did not have the data for the period between 2010 and 2015. 6.1.2.3 Land-based drivers The data used to characterize the intensity of inorganic pollution, organic pollution, population density and nutrient input in coastal areas come from an atlas of land use for coastal watershed in the Maritimes Region, hereafter the Land Use Atlas (guijarro-sabaniel2022?). We provide a brief summary of data and methods in this document. For more details, refer to (guijarro-sabaniel2022?). Coastal watershed boundaries in the Scotian Shelf Biogeographic Marine Management Sub-region were delineated using a digital elevation model (DEM) for each province was combined with national hydrographic data and calculating the flow direction and accumulation for each DEM. Stream orders for the stream network were then evaluated to locate the highest flow accumulation value for each watershed and given a value between 1 (lowest) and 4 (highest). The locations of these values were then used to identify pour points (e.g. river mouths) along the coast for each watershed. Spread of land stressors into coastal and marine environments was then modeled using a diffusive plume model using a density decay buffer based on stream order of the main pour points. The following sections describes how this model was used to characterize the intensity of inorganic pollution, nutrient input, organic pollution and population density in coastal areas of the Scotian Shelf. 6.1.2.3.1 Inorganic pollution The intensity of inorganic pollution was modelled using the percent area covered by impervious surfaces in each watershed. Impervious surfaces refer to articifial structures such as roads and parking lots and industrial areas such as ports that are covered by water-resistan materials. Impervious surfaces are used as a proxy of inorganic pollution under the assumption that most of this pollution comes from urban runoff. Impervious surfaces were identified in watershed using a combination of multiple datasets from the provinces New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Refer to the Land cover section and Table 1 of the Material and Methods in (guijarro-sabaniel2022?) for more details. 6.1.2.3.2 Organic pollution We used the percent cover of agriculture land use in each watershed as a proxy of the intensity organic pollution in each watershed. The percent area covered by agricultural land in each watershed was identified in watershed using a combination of multiple datasets from the provinces New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Refer to the Land cover section and Table 1 of the Material and Methods in (guijarro-sabaniel2022?) for more details. 6.1.2.3.3 Population density This intensity of stress caused by watershed population in coastal areas was modelled using the population density in each watershed in \\(person * ha^{-1}\\). Total population was estimated as the number of civic address datasets from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia multiplied by the average number of residents per household (i.e. 2.3) obtained from Statistics Canada. Population density was then evaluated as the total population in a watershed divided by the watershed area in hectares. 6.1.2.3.4 Nutrient input We used data from (kelly2021a?) to obtain the intensity of nutrient input in coastal areas of the Scotian Shelf. (kelly2021a?) used data from the Land Use Atlas to estimate nitrogen loading in coastal areas with the Nitrogen Loading Model (NLM) framework (valiela1997?; valiela2000?; mciver2015?; nagel2018?) to estimate total (dissolved) nitrogen from point and non-point source inputs in coastal areas from atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use, and wastewater disposal. Data and methods used to apply the NLM framework are described in details in (kelly2021a?). 6.1.3 Fisheries The intensity and distribution of commercial fisheries on the Scotian Shelf was assessed using the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’s logbook program (dfo2021b?); these logbooks provide a thorough, if not exhaustive, overview of fisheries in eastern Canada. We used data between 2010 and 2021 to characterize the distribution and the intensity of commercial fisheries on the Scotian Shelf. This period was characterized by 2986667 fishing activities targeting 80 species and a total of 111 species were captured when considering bycatch. Fishing activities are performed using a variety of gear types (e.g. trap, trawl, dredge, driftnet, hand line, longline, scuba diving, purse seine, seine, beach seine and jig fishing), which can have different effects on species and habitats. Fisheries activities were therefore divided based on the type of environmental effects attributed to specific gear types according to the categories suggested by (halpern2008a?) and used by (beauchesne2020?) for the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (Tables 6.2 and 6.3): demersal, destructive, high bycatch (DD) demersal, non-destructive, high bycatch (DNH) demersal, non-destructive, low bycatch (DNL) pelagic, high bycatch (PHB) pelagic, low bycatch (PLB) Gear types can be further classified into fixed or mobile gear (Table 6.3). We used the type of mobility to evaluate an expected area of effect for each fishing event, using radii of 200 and 2000 meters for fixed and mobile gear types, respectively (beauchesne2020?). This approach, while decreasing precision, considers the potential uncertainty associated with fishing activity coordinates, gear mobility, and the absence of start and end coordinates for mobile gear. Table 6.2: Description of commercial fishing catagories used to characterize the intensity and distribution of fisheries on the Scotian Shelf. Accronym Category Description DD Demersal, destructive, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear that may damage habitats or substrate, e.g. trawling and dragging. DNL Demersal, non-destructive, low-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear with little or no bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., deep-sea fishing. DNH Demersal, non-destructive, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using demersal fishing gear with high bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., trap and seine. PLB Pelagic, low-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using pelagic fishing gear with little or no bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., line fishing, purse seine. PHB Pelagic, high-bycatch Commercial fishing activities using pelagic fishing gear with high bycatch and not causing habitat modification, e.g., gillnet and longline. Table 6.3: Classification of gear types based on their environmental effects and mobility.

For each period considered in the assessment (2010-2015 and 2016-2021) and each fishing category, we used the mean annual biomass captured per grid cell to capture the intensity and distribution of as the assessment of the intensity and distribution of fisheries on the Scotian Shelf. 6.1.4 Marine traffic 6.1.4.1 Shipping The data used to characterize shipping come the Global Fishing Watch, which provides shipping data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data globally. We obtained data between 2017 and 2020 that characterize monthly commercial shipping (e.g. cargo, reefer, tanker, bunker) as rasters with a 0.1 degree resolution, either as the number of vessels or the total hours of vessel presence in each grid cell (gfw2022?). The data was also available either as direct observations from the AIS data, or interpolated to a regular interval of five minutes between points. We used the sum of monthly interpolated number of all vessel types in each grid cell to obtain an assessment of annual shipping intensity on the Scotian Shelf. When then resampled the 0.1 degree resolution grid to our own study grid. We used the mean annual shipping intensity value between 2017 and 2020 for both periods considered in the assessment. 6.2 Species The assessment considers 172 marine, 8 marine mammal, and 25 sea bird taxa, for a total of 205 taxa considered. We also assumed that phytoplankton and zooplankton species were present throughout the St. Lawrence System since these taxa are missing from our dataset and are required to properly consider trophic dynamics. The following sections describe the data and approaches used to evaluate their distribution on the Scotian Shelf 6.2.1 Marine species 6.2.1.1 Biotic data We used taxa occurrence data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DF) ecosystem spring (dfo2020b?), summer (dfo2020c?), and 4vsw (dfo2020?) surveys. These surveys collect data to monitor the distriution and abundance of fish and invertebrates through the Scotian Shelf, Bay of Fundy and Georges Bank. We formatted the list of taxa considered for the analyses gy combining and removing taxa based on expert knowledge and bibliographic research (e.g. species of the same genus and hard to distinguish in situ were combined). Only taxa with at least 50 observations were considered for the assessment. This process yielded NA occurrences and 556191 absences for 172 on the Scotial Shelf (Table 6.4). All species scientific names were resolved using the taxize R package (chamberlain2013?; chamberlain2019?). Table 6.4: List of marine species obtained through Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DF) ecosystem spring (dfo2020b?), summer (dfo2020c?), and 4vsw (dfo2020?) surveys on the Scotian Shelf, Bay of Fundy and Goerges Bank.

the bottom-water and surface-water conditions on the Scotian Shelf using data from Bio-ORACLE, which provides geophysical, biotic and environmental data layers for surface and benthic marine environments (bosch2022?; tyberghein2012?; assis2018?), the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) offering a global terrain model for ocean and land, providing elevation data, in meters, on a 15 arc-second interval grid (gebco?), and the Bedford Institute of Oceanography North Atlantic Model (BNAM) averaged over the 1990 to 2015 period for monthly temperatures and salinities at the bottome and at the surface (wang2018?; wang2018a?; wang2018b?).

Surface salinity (wang2018?); (wang2018b?) 6.2.1.3 Taxa distribution We evaluated the distribution of taxa on the Scotian Shelf using the Random Forest ensemble learner (breiman2001?). We used the default parameters of the randomForest R package to classify the presence or absence of taxa: 500 trees and the number of variables in the random subset at each node set to the square root of the number of variables (liaw2002?). All 23 abiotic variables (Table (tab:abiotic)) were used to model the distribution of species. The performance of each modell was evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and True Skilled Statistics [TSS; Table (tab:spnm); (allouche2006?)]. We predicted the spatial distribution of all taxa within the grid of our area of interest and performed a smoothing of predictions using a bisquare kernel smoothing approach (dossantos2018?) with a 5 km radius to avoid granular distributions; this is done that affect the assessment of species co-occurrences ncecessary for the subsequent network-scale cumualtive effects assessment. A threshold of 0.5 was used to transform continuous predictions to binary distributions, identifying areas where taxa are most likely to be found. 6.2.2 Marine mammals The distribution fo marine mammals in the area of interest comes from the second edition of a guidebook published for mariners who frequent the Northwest Atlantic (wwfromm2021?). The purpose of this guide is to inform mariners on the problem of collisions between vessels and whales, how to minimize such incidents, the various species of whales and leatherback turtles in the area and where they might be present, and on areas where heightened vigilance is required. Nine species of marine mammals were selected for this guide based on their conservation status and their known risk of collision with vessels (wwfromm2021?; wwfromm2021b?). The distribution of each marine mammal was assessed throught the integration of 14 datasets from scientific and opportunistic surveys between 2010-2015 (Table 6.6; (wwfromm2021c?)). The area of interest covered by the guide covers the geographic boundaries of \\(40^o\\) to \\(55^o\\) N and -72\\(^o\\) to -48\\(^o\\) W. The area of interest was divided into a regular 0.05\\(^o\\) x 0.05\\(^o\\) grid and the number of sightings recorded in the 14 available databases was calculated for each species considered. A Gaussian smoothing – i.e. an interpolation method based on a normal distribution – of 0.2\\(^o\\) was then applied to the grid. Values in each grid cells were then normalized by the total number of sightings for a species and log-transformed to minimize the effect of extreme values. The caveats that accompany these maps in the guide and are reported verbatim in this report: Sighting effort was not quantified and varies considerably in time and space. The data represent the relative occurrence of reported sightings rather than the actual density or abundance of the species. The quality of some of the sighting data is unknown. Sightings are reported from individuals with varying degrees of expertise in identifying marine mammals. Table 6.6: List of scientific and opportunistic datasets used to generate maps, including informations on the period covered by the data, the number of species and the number of observations of one or more individuals available for the analysis, and the owner of the dataset.

For our study, we resampled the distributional maps available in the guide to integrate them into our own grid. The values were then normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing each value by the maximum value observed within the grid for each species. The resulting values can be interpreted as the relative density of marine mammal sightings, with values of 0 representing a low relative density and a value of 1 a high relative density. All cells with values greater than 0 were used to identify the binary distribution of marine mammals.

All sightings of individual bird species or bird groups from the vessel and aerial surveys between 2006 and 2022 were combined to evaluate the distribution of birds in the area of interest. A total of 25 bird species / groups were obtained (Table 6.8). Table 6.8: List of sea birds obtained through the Eastern Canada Seabirds at Sea (ECSAS) database (gjerdrum2012?; eccc2022b?).

The area of interest was divided into a regular 0.05\\(^o\\) x 0.05\\(^o\\) degrees grid. For each species or species group, the number of sightings recorded in the ECSAS database was evaluated in each grid cell. A Gaussian smoothing - i.e. an interpolation method based on a normal distribution - of 20 \\(km\\) was then applied to the grid. A log transformation was then applied to minimize the effect of extreme values on the resulting maps. Cell values were then normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing by the maximum value observed for each bird across the area of interest. All cells with values greater than 0 were used to identify the binary distribution of sea birds. 6.3 Metaweb We predicted the metaweb of the Scotian Shelf, i.e. the network of biotic interactions, using a recommender approach (beauchesne2016?). Here, we provide a brief overview of the approach, but refer to (beauchesne2016?) for more details. The approach is built on a series of ligical steps that predict a candidate resource list for each taxon considered based on empirically observed interactions and on the similarity between consumers and resources. It uses the K-nearest neighbour It predicts pairwise interactions given taxonomic and dietery similarity between taxa using the K-nearest neighbour algorithm [KNN; (murphy2012?)]. Predictions are informed by a catalogue of empirical interactions from all over the world (beauchesne2016?). The interactions catalogue was built using food web data (brose2005?; kortsch2015?; universityofcanberra2016?), predator-prey interactions (barnes2008?) and pairwise interactions from the GloBI database (poelen2014?; poelen2019?). We limited the compendium to taxa found in marine and coastal ecosystems. The original interaction catalogue was built for a cumulative effects assessment of global changes on the food web of the St. Lawrence System (beauchesne2020c?). The interaction catalogue was updated for the assessment of the Scotian Shelf using the GloBI database. We used the taxonomic families from the list of species considered for the assessment to identify all member species of those families for which interactions were available on the GloBI dataset using the rglobi package (poelen2019?). We then combined the original interaction catalogue with the interactions extracted from GloBI to form a new catalogue of biotic interactions. This process yielded a total of X interactions for X species to inform interaction predictions. Taxa similarity was evaluated from taxonomic classification and sets of consumers or resources using the Tanimoto similarity measure. A weight of 0.5 was given to taxonomy and consumers or resources to consider them simultaneously (desjardins-proulx2016?). The taxonomy of all taxa considered was accessed and validated from WoRMS (wormseditorialboard2017?) using the taxize package (chamberlain2013?; chamberlain2019?). We included the main phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa found in the St. Lawrence System to predict the metaweb (morissette2003?; savenkoff2004?; savenkoff2012?); we then grouped predictions under phytoplankton or zooplankton. This yielded a total of X taxa (\\(S\\)) for which we predicted a metaweb structured by X links (\\(L\\)), a link density (\\(L_{moy} = L/S\\)) of X and a connectance (\\(C = L/S^2\\)) of X, which is within range of most reported food webs (dunne2002a?). 6.4 Species-specific sensitivity 6.5 Trophic sensitivity "],["results.html", "7 Results", " 7 Results "],["eDrivers.html", "8 eDrivers", " 8 eDrivers "],["atlas.html", "9 Atlas 9.1 Stressors 9.2 Species 9.3 Cumulative stressors 9.4 Species richness 9.5 Cumulative exposure 9.6 Cumulative effects", " 9 Atlas 9.1 Stressors 9.1.1 Climate 9.1.2 Coastal 9.1.3 Fisheries 9.1.4 Marine traffic 9.2 Species 9.2.1 Marine species 9.2.2 Marine mammals 9.2.3 Sea birds 9.3 Cumulative stressors 9.4 Species richness 9.5 Cumulative exposure 9.6 Cumulative effects "],["appendix1.html", "Appendix 1", " Appendix 1 Automatically generate data table from pipedat workflow "],["appendix.html", "Appendix 2", " Appendix 2 Automatically generate a contact list from pipedat workflow "],["appendix3.html", "Appendix 3", " Appendix 3 Description of the research compendium prepared to structure the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence and the river Saguenay. ceanav This repository contains the research compendium for the pilot project on the cumulative effects assessment of marine vessel activities in the St. Lawrence and the river Saguenay.
