Description: This package provides pipelines to access, load, and format 
    a variety of data from multiple sources programatically. The intent of 
    this package is to support the varying projects undertaken under the 
    umbrella project Ecosystem Assessments. Certain datasets are directly 
    accessed through APIs and open data portals, while others require a 
    local copy of the raw data for varying reasons such as data whose 
    distribution is limited or protected by data sharing agreements.
