[["index.html", "1 Context", " 1 Context In 2016, Fisheries and Oceans Canada renewed its research capacity to better understand the nature and extent of multiple anthropogenic stressors in the marine environment, in order to provide a foundation for policies and practices that protect the health of Canada’s oceans for future generations. The relevance of the proposed project to Oceans and Climate Change Science is related to the need to: 1) improve understanding of how multiple drivers interact to affect the integrity of ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales, 2) improve evaluation of the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple drivers. "],["project-description.html", "2 Project description", " 2 Project description Marine spatial planning approaches for the use and conservation of marine resources are required, particularly in the context of fluctuating natural and human drivers. A recent project led by this team developed marine spatial planning approaches and tools to evaluate the cumulative impacts on the structure of the ecological communities of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada. The project identified four specific goals: Evaluate the distribution and intensity of stressors in the St. Lawrence, Characterize the spatial structure of the communities of the St. Lawrence, Evaluate the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple stressors, and Evaluate cumulative impacts on the communities of the St. Lawrence from the cartography of stressors (Obj. 1) and communities (Obj. 2), as well as the vulnerability of communities to multiple stressors (Obj 3). A component of this project consisted of developing and launching the open knowledge platform eDrivers to facilitate the process of gathering experts committed to structuring, standardizing and sharing knowledge on drivers in support of science and management. Data on 22 coastal, climate, fisheries and marine traffic drivers were summarized through collaborations, existing environmental initiatives and open data portals. The distribution of over 200 species was modeled and predicted throughout the St. Lawrence System, a simulation approach was used to infer the vulnerability of individual species in the St. Lawrence as a function of their position in complex food webs, and a spatially explicit evaluation of cumulative impacts on the ecological communities of the St. Lawrence was generated. This proposed project aims to apply and further develop the approaches and tools created in the St. Lawrence to the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion using a species-distribution and vulnerability mapping approach (distinct from habitat impact mapping approach being applied by the Ecosystem Stressors program). This project will create and generate data layers that will be useful for Marine Spatial Planning purposes. "],["project-objectives-and-anticipated-benefits.html", "3 Project Objectives and Anticipated Benefits 3.1 Geographic Scope 3.2 Project Objectives", " 3 Project Objectives and Anticipated Benefits 3.1 Geographic Scope Offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion 3.2 Project Objectives To provide a systematic characterization of the distribution and intensity of drivers; To map the spatial structure of biological communities; To evaluate the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple drivers, and; To conduct a spatial evaluation of cumulative impacts for individual species and at the community level, using outputs from objectives 1 (distribution and intensity of drivers), 2 (spatial structure of biological communities), and 3 (food web vulnerability simulations due to multiple drivers). Anticipated benefits This project would benefit an approach towards efficient, adaptive and holistic ecosystem-based management using marine spatial tools in the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion. Making data on drivers and ecological communities readily accessible will enhance the ability to provide efficient, consistent, and timely science guidance. This project will foster efficient and functional open science by using and further developing a fully open, transparent and replicable open knowledge platform eDrivers. This adaptive platform provides an ever-improving collection of knowledge to gain efficient access to comparable data-based knowledge on the exposure of ecosystems to multiple threats. Currently, this platform synthesizes the spatial distribution and intensity of drivers in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. This proposed project will offer continuity to this platform and will guarantee comparability between data products from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the offshore Scotian Shelf bioregion. Comparability between ecosystems is an important aspect to support the Oceans and Climate Change Science program at DFO.

"],["project-methodology.html", "6 Project methodology", " 6 Project methodology Systematic characterization of the distribution and intensity of drivers in the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion An inventory of drivers in the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion will be developed based upon the list previously assembled in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Inventory of drivers will be prioritized based upon three levels of priority: high (must be included), medium (beneficial to include) and low (inclusion of this driver is not at this stage). Development of a communication and engagement strategy to streamline the process of data request and assembly from multiple sources. Development of reproducible work flows to allow for efficient and prompt integration of data as it becomes available. Use and expansion of the eDrivers open knowledge platform for collating data and knowledge on multiple drivers in a comparable and interoperable fashion Approaches to map data gaps and uncertainty may be explored to identify opportunities to provide recommendations for future work. Spatial structure of ecological communities To access DFO Maritimes Region databases (e.g. Ecosystem Research Vessel Survey) and use data to model and predict the distribution of several species, including predictions related to the - spatial structure of food webs throughout the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion. This will be accomplished by implementing a combined modeling approach using the distribution probabilities of individual species with a machine learning algorithm to reconstruct the network of trophic interactions linking sets of co-occurring species. Uncertainty associated with data collection and modeling will be explicitly discussed and presented in each section of the project. Vulnerability of food webs to multiple drivers A theoretical simulation approach was developed in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence to explore how food webs are impacted by drivers affecting multiple biological processes such as mortality, behavior and physiology. This approach will be used in the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion, including simulations to infer the vulnerability of individual species as a function of their position in the food web. Cumulative impacts on food webs A spatial evaluation of cumulative impacts on the biological communities of the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion will be performed using the outputs from objectives 1, 2, and 3 outlined in this section. This will allow for an evaluation of cumulative impacts at the species and at the community level.
