  abstract = {Nutrient pollution derived from human land-use activities remains a major cause of the eutrophication of coastal ecosystems around the world. In this study, we conduct a nutrient loading analysis for the coastal watersheds bordering the Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf of Atlantic Canada, a cold temperate region of the Northwest Atlantic that exhibits strong gradients in oceanographic conditions and human uses of the coastal zone, and where coastal development is expected to increase in the coming decades. Our objective was to apply the Nitrogen Loading Model (NLM) framework to determine the regional distribution and intensity of nitrogen inputs from land-based sources (wastewater, atmospheric deposition, land use, fertilizer applications, and regional industries) to coastal marine environments, and subsequently identify coastal embayments at risk of developing symptoms of eutrophication. Across all 109 watersheds examined, the estimated mean total nitrogen load varied by three orders of magnitude. The largest loads occurred in the most heavily urbanized and densely populated watersheds, where wastewater inputs contributed the most ({$>$}80\%) to loading rates. Where the footprint of human activity was small, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen was an important contributor to the total load; however, localized point sources (i.e. seafood processing, fur farming) were significant contributors to the total load in smaller sized watersheds. Coastal embayments with small surface areas and low tidal exchange volumes were most likely to have estuarine loading rates that exceeded previously established thresholds for the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation (e.g., eelgrass). In contrast, none of the embayments were deemed likely to develop anoxia. This analysis enables a novel comparison of nitrogen loading from watersheds across a range of land cover types, watershed characteristics, and human land-use activities, while providing a baseline for the detection of future environmental change in the region. Overall, we emphasize the importance of including human activities that occur on the landscape in future marine coastal planning.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen loading from coastal watersheds is a principal factor associated with the decline in eelgrass bed health and cover in estuaries worldwide. We apply the Nitrogen Loading Model (NLM) framework developed in Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts to 7 estuaries in eastern New Brunswick. Using watershed-specific information on human population, wastewater production, atmospheric deposition, and land use in each watershed we estimate annual input of Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN) from point and non-point sources. We also estimate flushing time of each estuary using available hydrodynamic and bathymetric data incorporated in a tidal prism model. Finally, we validate the NLM results by testing the link between estimated nitrogen loading, flushing time and nitrogen signals in eelgrass tissue including nitrogen content and stable isotopes. Overall, total nitrogen load (kg~TDN~yr-1) was strongly dependent on watershed and estuary size, while loading rate per unit watershed area (yield) was linked to watershed population density. Atmospheric deposition was the largest contributor of nitrogen to all estuaries except one, where seafood processing effluent was the greatest source. Stable isotope analysis of eelgrass tissue reflected this distinction, with high {$\delta$}15N values of 8\textendash 10\textperthousand{} related to high wastewater loading, compared to 2\textendash 6.5\textperthousand{} in the other estuaries that receive proportionally more atmospheric deposition. Tissue nitrogen content was positively related to nitrogen yields and loading rate per volume of estuary, highlighting the influence of variable watershed:estuary size ratio. Multiple regression analysis identified a significant interaction between nitrogen yield and flushing time on eelgrass tissue nitrogen content and isotopes, pointing to the mitigating effect an estuary's quick flushing time can have on the expression of nitrogen enrichment in primary producers. The compilation of new information on nitrogen loading to east Canadian estuaries is a novel contribution from a region where human influences are still at a relatively low level, and hence will add to existing information from cold temperate, mainly forested watershed-estuary environments.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a model to estimate nitrogen loading to watersheds and receiving waters, and then apply the model to gain insight about sources, losses, and transport of nitrogen in groundwater moving through a coastal watershed. The model is developed from data of the Waquoit Bay Land Margin Ecosystems Research project (WBLMER), and from syntheses of published information. The WBLMER nitrogen loading model first estimates inputs by atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use, and wastewater to surfaces of the major types of land use (natural vegetation, turf, agricultural land, residential areas, and impervious surfaces) within the landscape. Then, the model estimates losses of nitrogen in the various compartments of the watershed ecosystem. For atmospheric and fertilizer nitrogen, the model allows losses in vegetation and soils, in the vadose zone, and in the aquifer. For wastewater nitrogen, the model allows losses in septic systems and effluent plumes, and it adds further losses that occur during diffuse transport within aquifers. The calculation of losses is done separately for each major type of land cover, because the processes and loss rates involved differ for different tesserae of the land cover mosaic. If groundwater flows into a freshwater body, the model adds a loss of nitrogen for traversing the freshwater body and then subjects the surviving nitrogen to losses in the aquifer. The WBLMER model is developed for Waquoit Bay, but with inputs for local conditions it is applicable to other rural to suburban watersheds underlain by unconsolidated sandy sediments. Model calculations suggest that the atmosphere contributes 56\%, fertilizer 14\%, and wastewater 27\% of the nitrogen delivered to the surface of the watershed of Waquoit Bay. Losses within the watershed amount to 89\% of atmospheric nitrogen, 79\% of fertilizer nitrogen, and 65\% of wastewater nitrogen. The net result of inputs to the watershed surface and losses within the watershed is that wastewater becomes the largest source (48\%) of nitrogen loads to receiving estuaries, followed by atmospheric deposition (30\%) and fertilizer use (15\%). The nitrogen load to estuaries of Waquoit Bay is transported primarily through land parcels covered by residential areas (39\%, mainly via wastewater), natural vegetation (21\%, by atmospheric deposition), and turf (16\%, by atmospheric deposition and fertilizers). Other land covers were involved in lesser throughputs of nitrogen. The model results have implications for management of coastal landscapes and water quality. Most attention should be given to wastewater disposal within the watershed, particularly within 200 m of the shore. Rules regarding setbacks of septic system location relative to shore and nitrogen retention ability of septic systems, will be useful in control of wastewater nitrogen loading. Installation of multiple conventional leaching fields or septic systems in high-flow parcels could be one way to increase nitrogen retention. Control of fertilizer use can help to a modest degree, particularly for optional uses such as lawns situated near shore. Conservation of parcels of accreting natural vegetation should be given high priority, because these environments effectively intercept atmospheric deposition. Areas upgradient from freshwater bodies should be given low priority in plans to control nitrogen loading, because ponds intercept much of the nitrogen transported from upgradient.},
