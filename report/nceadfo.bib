  abstract = {Motivation The availability of user-friendly, high-resolution global environmental datasets is crucial for bioclimatic modelling. For terrestrial environments, WorldClim has served this purpose since 2005, but equivalent marine data only became available in 2012, with pioneer initiatives like Bio-ORACLE providing data layers for several ecologically relevant variables. Currently, the available marine data packages have not yet been updated to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions nor to present times, and are mostly restricted to the top surface layer of the oceans, precluding the modelling of a large fraction of the benthic diversity that inhabits deeper habitats. To address this gap, we present a significant update of Bio-ORACLE for new future climate scenarios, present-day conditions and benthic layers (near sea bottom). The reliability of data layers was assessed using a cross-validation framework against in situ quality-controlled data. This test showed a generally good agreement between our data layers and the global climatic patterns. We also provide a package of functions in the R software environment (sdmpredictors) to facilitate listing, extraction and management of data layers and allow easy integration with the available pipelines for bioclimatic modelling. Main types of variable contained Surface and benthic layers for water temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll, sea ice, current velocity, phytoplankton, primary productivity, iron and light at bottom.

  abstract = {The St. Lawrence is a vast and complex socio-ecological system providing a wealth of services sustaining numerous economic sectors. These ecosystems are subject to significant human pressures that overlap and potentially interact with climate driven environmental changes. Our objective in this paper is to systematically characterize the distribution and intensity of drivers in the St. Lawrence System. To do so, we launch eDrivers, an open knowledge platform gathering experts committed to structuring, standardizing and sharing knowledge on drivers in support of science and management. We gathered data on 22 coastal, climate, fisheries and marine traffic drivers through collaborations, existing environmental initiatives and open data portals. We show that few areas of the St. Lawrence are free of cumulative exposure. The Estuary, the Anticosti Gyre and coastal areas are particularly exposed, especially in the vicinity of urban centers. We identified 6 areas of distinct cumulative exposure regime that show that certain drivers typically co-occur in different regions of the St. Lawrence and that coastal areas are exposed to all driver types. Of particular concern are two threat complexes capturing most exposure hotspots that show the convergence of contrasting exposure regimes at the head of the Laurentian Channel. eDrivers was built on a series of guiding principles upholding existing data management and open science standards. We therefore expect it to evolve through time to address knowledge gaps and refine current driver layers. Ultimately, we believe that eDrivers represents a much needed solution that could radically influence broad scale research and management practices by increasing knowledge accessibility and interoperability.},

  abstract = {Abstract Evaluating the effects of multiple stressors on ecosystems is becoming increasingly vital with global changes. The role of species interactions in propagating the effects of stressors, although widely acknowledged, has yet to be formally explored. Here, we conceptualise how stressors propagate through food webs and explore how they affect simulated three-species motifs and food webs of the Canadian St. Lawrence System. We find that overlooking species interactions invariably underestimate the effects of stressors, and that synergistic and antagonistic effects through food webs are prevalent. We also find that interaction type influences a species' susceptibility to stressors; species in omnivory and tri-trophic food chain interactions in particular are sensitive and prone to synergistic and antagonistic effects. Finally, we find that apex predators were negatively affected and mesopredators benefited from the effects of stressors due to their trophic position in the St. Lawrence System, but that species sensitivity is dependent on food web structure. In conceptualising the effects of multiple stressors on food webs, we bring theory closer to practice and show that considering the intricacies of ecological communities is key to assess the net effects of stressors on species.},

  abstract = {Nutrient pollution derived from human land-use activities remains a major cause of the eutrophication of coastal ecosystems around the world. In this study, we conduct a nutrient loading analysis for the coastal watersheds bordering the Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf of Atlantic Canada, a cold temperate region of the Northwest Atlantic that exhibits strong gradients in oceanographic conditions and human uses of the coastal zone, and where coastal development is expected to increase in the coming decades. Our objective was to apply the Nitrogen Loading Model (NLM) framework to determine the regional distribution and intensity of nitrogen inputs from land-based sources (wastewater, atmospheric deposition, land use, fertilizer applications, and regional industries) to coastal marine environments, and subsequently identify coastal embayments at risk of developing symptoms of eutrophication. Across all 109 watersheds examined, the estimated mean total nitrogen load varied by three orders of magnitude. The largest loads occurred in the most heavily urbanized and densely populated watersheds, where wastewater inputs contributed the most ({$>$}80\%) to loading rates. Where the footprint of human activity was small, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen was an important contributor to the total load; however, localized point sources (i.e. seafood processing, fur farming) were significant contributors to the total load in smaller sized watersheds. Coastal embayments with small surface areas and low tidal exchange volumes were most likely to have estuarine loading rates that exceeded previously established thresholds for the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation (e.g., eelgrass). In contrast, none of the embayments were deemed likely to develop anoxia. This analysis enables a novel comparison of nitrogen loading from watersheds across a range of land cover types, watershed characteristics, and human land-use activities, while providing a baseline for the detection of future environmental change in the region. Overall, we emphasize the importance of including human activities that occur on the landscape in future marine coastal planning.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen loading from coastal watersheds is a principal factor associated with the decline in eelgrass bed health and cover in estuaries worldwide. We apply the Nitrogen Loading Model (NLM) framework developed in Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts to 7 estuaries in eastern New Brunswick. Using watershed-specific information on human population, wastewater production, atmospheric deposition, and land use in each watershed we estimate annual input of Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN) from point and non-point sources. We also estimate flushing time of each estuary using available hydrodynamic and bathymetric data incorporated in a tidal prism model. Finally, we validate the NLM results by testing the link between estimated nitrogen loading, flushing time and nitrogen signals in eelgrass tissue including nitrogen content and stable isotopes. Overall, total nitrogen load (kg~TDN~yr-1) was strongly dependent on watershed and estuary size, while loading rate per unit watershed area (yield) was linked to watershed population density. Atmospheric deposition was the largest contributor of nitrogen to all estuaries except one, where seafood processing effluent was the greatest source. Stable isotope analysis of eelgrass tissue reflected this distinction, with high {$\delta$}15N values of 8\textendash 10\textperthousand{} related to high wastewater loading, compared to 2\textendash 6.5\textperthousand{} in the other estuaries that receive proportionally more atmospheric deposition. Tissue nitrogen content was positively related to nitrogen yields and loading rate per volume of estuary, highlighting the influence of variable watershed:estuary size ratio. Multiple regression analysis identified a significant interaction between nitrogen yield and flushing time on eelgrass tissue nitrogen content and isotopes, pointing to the mitigating effect an estuary's quick flushing time can have on the expression of nitrogen enrichment in primary producers. The compilation of new information on nitrogen loading to east Canadian estuaries is a novel contribution from a region where human influences are still at a relatively low level, and hence will add to existing information from cold temperate, mainly forested watershed-estuary environments.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a model to estimate nitrogen loading to watersheds and receiving waters, and then apply the model to gain insight about sources, losses, and transport of nitrogen in groundwater moving through a coastal watershed. The model is developed from data of the Waquoit Bay Land Margin Ecosystems Research project (WBLMER), and from syntheses of published information. The WBLMER nitrogen loading model first estimates inputs by atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use, and wastewater to surfaces of the major types of land use (natural vegetation, turf, agricultural land, residential areas, and impervious surfaces) within the landscape. Then, the model estimates losses of nitrogen in the various compartments of the watershed ecosystem. For atmospheric and fertilizer nitrogen, the model allows losses in vegetation and soils, in the vadose zone, and in the aquifer. For wastewater nitrogen, the model allows losses in septic systems and effluent plumes, and it adds further losses that occur during diffuse transport within aquifers. The calculation of losses is done separately for each major type of land cover, because the processes and loss rates involved differ for different tesserae of the land cover mosaic. If groundwater flows into a freshwater body, the model adds a loss of nitrogen for traversing the freshwater body and then subjects the surviving nitrogen to losses in the aquifer. The WBLMER model is developed for Waquoit Bay, but with inputs for local conditions it is applicable to other rural to suburban watersheds underlain by unconsolidated sandy sediments. Model calculations suggest that the atmosphere contributes 56\%, fertilizer 14\%, and wastewater 27\% of the nitrogen delivered to the surface of the watershed of Waquoit Bay. Losses within the watershed amount to 89\% of atmospheric nitrogen, 79\% of fertilizer nitrogen, and 65\% of wastewater nitrogen. The net result of inputs to the watershed surface and losses within the watershed is that wastewater becomes the largest source (48\%) of nitrogen loads to receiving estuaries, followed by atmospheric deposition (30\%) and fertilizer use (15\%). The nitrogen load to estuaries of Waquoit Bay is transported primarily through land parcels covered by residential areas (39\%, mainly via wastewater), natural vegetation (21\%, by atmospheric deposition), and turf (16\%, by atmospheric deposition and fertilizers). Other land covers were involved in lesser throughputs of nitrogen. The model results have implications for management of coastal landscapes and water quality. Most attention should be given to wastewater disposal within the watershed, particularly within 200 m of the shore. Rules regarding setbacks of septic system location relative to shore and nitrogen retention ability of septic systems, will be useful in control of wastewater nitrogen loading. Installation of multiple conventional leaching fields or septic systems in high-flow parcels could be one way to increase nitrogen retention. Control of fertilizer use can help to a modest degree, particularly for optional uses such as lawns situated near shore. Conservation of parcels of accreting natural vegetation should be given high priority, because these environments effectively intercept atmospheric deposition. Areas upgradient from freshwater bodies should be given low priority in plans to control nitrogen loading, because ponds intercept much of the nitrogen transported from upgradient.},
