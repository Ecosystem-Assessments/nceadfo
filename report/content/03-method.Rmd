### Species-scale assessment {#speciesmethod}

The method developed by @halpern2008a uses 3 types of data: 1) the mapped presence or absence of valued components, *i.e.* species in this  case ($S_i$), 2) the spatial distribution and relative intensity (*i.e.* normalized between 0 and 1) of the environmental drivers considered ($D_j$), and 3) the species-specific sensitivity of each species to each driver ($\mu_{i,j}$) These data are then incorporated into a grid made up of cells of homogeneous size characterizing the study area. 

Cumulative effect predictions ($C_S$) are calculated for each cell ($x$) of the grid by summing up all individual driver effects over the set of species considered:

$$C_{S_x} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m S_{i,x} * D_{j,x} * \mu_{i,j} \label{eq1}$$

This method proposes the calculation of a relative indicator of cumulative effects to predict the risks associated with the effects of multiple environmental drivers on species. This is in opposition to an absolute indicator of effects, which would identify an observable change in the state of species populations resulting from the effects of cumulative environmental drivers, such as a decline in the beluga whale population in the St. Lawrence Estuary in response to cumulative environmental drivers. A relative indicator instead allows for a comparison of the various environmental drivers according to their intensity within the region studied and their effects on the species considered. The results are therefore more appropriately as a probability of risk. The results of the cumulative effects assessment using this approach are presented in section \@ref(ceaspresults) of the report. Cumulative effects predictions can be decomposed to explore the relative contribution of all combinations of drivers and species (Figure \@ref(fig:icfig)). A complete exploration of all driver-species combinations is therefore possible (Figure \@ref(fig:icfig)).

### Network-scale assessment {#networkmethod}

The approach developed by @beauchesne2020c builds on recent progress in theoretical ecology [@stouffer2007; @stouffer2012; @beauchesne2021] to predict the net effects of environmental drivers by considering both direct and trophically-mediated indirect effects in ecological communities. The approach focuses on sub-networks of interacting species called motifs [@milo2002]. Motifs are subsets of $p$-species interactions that, when put together, construct whole food webs and provide a mesoscale characterization of the structural properties of ecological communities [@bascompte2005; @stouffer2007; @stouffer2010; @stouffer2011; @bramonmora2018]. In a $n$-species food web ($n \geq p$), the collection of $p$-species motifs ($p \leq n$) in which species $i$ is involved in ($M_i = \{m_{i,1},m_{i,2},...,m_{i,x}\}$) forms its motif census [$M_i$; @stouffer2012; @beauchesne2021]. The motif census provides an overview of all the interactions likely to affect the propagation of environmental pressure to a focal species. Only the most abundant 3-species motifs observed in empirical food webs are considered [*i.e.* trophic food chain, omnivory, exploitative and apparent composition; @camacho2007; @stouffer2010] to assess a species motif census.

For any 3-species motif $m_{i,x}$ in species $i$’s motif census ($M_i$), the net effect of all drivers on the 3 species is evaluated as the sum of their direct effects on all species involved -- that is, the sum of species-specific responses $S_{m_{i,x}}$ -- as in @halpern2008a:

$$S_{m_{i,x}} = \sum_{k=1}^3 \sum_j D_j * \mu_{k,j} \label{eq2}$$


where $k$ denotes the 3 species involved in motif $m_{i,x}$, $D_j$ is the standardized intensity of driver $j$ (scaled between 0 and 1; see [Environmental drivers module](#drmodule)) and $\mu_{k,j}$ is the relative species-specific sensitivity of species $k$ to driver $j$ (range between 0 and 1; see [Species-specific sensitivity module](#sssmodule)). The relative contribution of drivers to direct effects are those that affect focal species $i$, whereas the relative contribution to indirect effects are those that affect the species interacting with species $i$ in $m_{i,x}$.

A species sensitivity to trophically-mediated effects -- which we refer to as a species' trophic sensitivity ($T_{i,m_{i,x}}$) -- also depends on the structure of the community, its trophic position and the specific entry points of stressors in the system [see @beauchesne2021]. For instance, a predator in a food chain will more sensitive to the propagation of environmental pressures than a resource. We use simulated trophic sensitivities as weighting factors (scaled between 0 and 1) to modulate the effects of stressors to focal species $i$’s given its position in 3-species motifs and the specific pathways of effects -- *i.e.* the entry points -- through which stressors affect interacting species (see [Trophic sensitivity module](#trsmodule) and @beauchesne2021 for more details):

$$C_{i,m_{i,x}} = T_{i,m_{i,x}} * S_{m_{i,x}} \label{eq3}$$


where $C_{i,m_{i,x}}$ is the cumulative effect of all drivers on species $i$ in $m_{i,x}$, and $T_{i,m_{i,x}}$ is the trophic sensitivity of species $i$ to the effects of drivers in $m_{i,x}$. 

For a single species $i$, cumulative effects are then summarized by averaging the cumulative effects across its motif census to obtain an unbiased measure of the topological configuration of species interactions [@stouffer2012]:

$$C_{N_{i,x}} = \frac{1}{|M_i|} \sum_{m _{i,x} \in M_i} C_{i,m_{i,x}} \label{eq4}$$


where $C_{N_i}$ is the network-scale cumulative effects assessment on species $i$ and $|M_i|$ is the number of motifs in the motif census of species $i$. Finally, we summarize over all $n$ species locally to obtain a community-aggregated assessment of network-scale cumulative effects:

$$C_N = \sum_i C_{N_i} \label{eq5}$$


The full model for network-scale cumulative effects assessment is thus:

$$C_N = \sum_i \frac{1}{|M_i|} \sum_{m_{i,x} \in M_i} T_{i,m_{i,x}} * \sum_{k=1}^3 \sum_j D_j * \mu_{k,j} \label{eq6}$$



## Partial models

The general cumulative effects assessment model can easily be broken down into partial models to explore simplified portions of the assessment. We therefore present three additional indicators allowing the results of the assessment to be explored. 

### Cumulative stressors and hotspots {#strcummethod}

Considering only the spatial distribution and relative intensity of the environmental stressors considered ($S_j$) provides an assessment of the cumulative stressors $E_{S,x}$ [@beauchesne2020], which corresponds to the total of all the environmental stressors $S$ in each cell $x$ considered for the assessment:

$$E_{S_x} = \sum_{j=1}^m S_{j,x} \label{eq2}$$

The cumulative stressor assessment of environmental stressors identifies the sites that are most exposed to the potential effects of the environmental stressors considered for the cumulative effects assessment. It does not provide an effects assessment, since it only considers the stressors, and their intensity and distribution. However, it does allow us to assess the environments that are most likely to be affected by the stressors in our study area. 

In order to limit an over-representation of stressors composed of several subcategories, it is also possible to normalize the intensity values of a stressor category by the number of sub-categories that compose it. For example, a stressor consisting of 10 categories would have a higher weight than a stressor consisting of only one category. To normalize the intensity values, the intensity of these subcategories need only be divided by the number of subcategories, *e.g.* for a category composed of 10 subcategories, the intensity is divided by 10. 

Using the cumulative stressor assessment, it is also possible to obtain an assessment of cumulative stressor hotspots, which identify environments where environmental stressors co-occur at high relative intensities [@beauchesne2020]. The cumulative hotspots $E_{H_x}$ is calculated in each cell of the study grid and corresponds to the sum of stressors whose intensity is contained in their respective $80th$ percentile: 

$$E_{H_x} = \sum_{j=1}^m \mathbb{1} (S_{j,x} \; \epsilon \; P_{80, S_j})$$

where $P_{80, S_j}$ is the $80th$ percentile of stressor $j$. The results of normalized and non-normalized cumulative stressors and cumulative hotspots are presented in section \@ref(strcumresult).


#### Cumulative valued components {#cvcummethod}

Considering only the mapped presence or absence of the valued components considered ($CV_i$) provides an assessment of the cumulative stressors $E_{S,x}$, which corresponds to the total of all environmental stressors $CV$ in each cell $x$:

$$E_{CV_x} = \sum_{i=1}^n CV_{i,x} \label{eq3}$$

The cumulative footprint assessment identifies the environments with the highest content of valued components. As with the cumulative stressor assessment, it does not provide an effects assessment, since it only considers the valued components. However, it does allow us to assess the environments that are most important for the valued components in our study area. The presence of valued components can also be normalized by the number of valued component categories to avoid over-representation of valued components composed of multiple categories (see section \@ref(strcummethod)). The results of normalized and non-normalized valued components are presented in section \@ref(cvcumresult).


#### Cumulative exposure {#cumexpmethod}

The intersection of the assessment of the stressors and the cumulative valued components provide the third partial model that we are presenting in addition to the overall model, *i.e.* cumulative exposure. The cumulative exposure $E_{E,x}$ is the product of the intensity of the environmental stressors $S_{j,x}$ and the presence of the valued components $CV_{i,x}$ in each cell $x$:

$$E_{E_x} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m CV_{i,x} * S_{j,x} \label{eq4}$$

Cumulative exposure provides an assessment of environments where there is greater overlap of valued components and environmental stressors. Although this metric does not predict the effect of stressors on valued components, it does identify environments where the valued components are most likely to be subjected to the effects of the environmental stressors considered. Cumulative exposure also makes it possible to delimit all the environments where cumulative effects could occur, since stressors and valued components must overlap in order to detect an effect; as such, this metric captures a significant portion of cumulative effects even though it does not incorporate the vulnerability of valued components to stressors. As with the cumulative valued components and stressors, cumulative exposure can be normalized by the number of stressor and valued component categories to avoid over-representation of valued components composed of multiple categories (see section \@ref(strcummethod)). The results of normalized and non-normalized cumulative exposure are presented in section \@ref(cumexpresult).
