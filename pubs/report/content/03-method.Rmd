### Species-scale assessment {#speciesmethod}

The method developed by @halpern2008a uses 3 types of data, which we will refer to as modules in this assessment: 1) the mapped presence or absence of valued components, *i.e.* species in this  case ($S_i$), 2) the spatial distribution and relative intensity (*i.e.* normalized between 0 and 1) of the environmental drivers considered ($D_j$), and 3) the species-specific sensitivity of each species to each driver ($\mu_{i,j}$) These data are then incorporated into a grid made up of cells of homogeneous size characterizing the study area. 

Cumulative effect predictions ($C_S$) are calculated for each cell ($x$) of the grid by summing up all individual driver effects over the set of species considered:

$$C_{S_x} = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m S_{i,x} * D_{j,x} * \mu_{i,j} \label{eq1}$$

This method proposes the calculation of a relative indicator of cumulative effects to predict the risks associated with the effects of multiple environmental drivers on species. This is in opposition to an absolute indicator of effects, which would identify an observable change in the state of species populations resulting from the effects of cumulative environmental drivers, such as a decline in the beluga whale population in the St. Lawrence Estuary in response to cumulative environmental drivers. A relative indicator instead allows for a comparison of the various environmental drivers according to their intensity within the region studied and their effects on the species considered. The results are therefore more appropriately as a probability of risk. The results of the cumulative effects assessment using this approach are presented in section \@ref(ceaspresults) of the report. Cumulative effects predictions can be decomposed to explore the relative contribution of all combinations of drivers and species (Figure \@ref(fig:icfig)). A complete exploration of all driver-species combinations is therefore possible (Figure \@ref(fig:icfig)).

```{r icfig, fig.cap = "A fictitious example of spatial assessment of cumulative effects using the methodology suggested by [@halpern2008a]. The assessment begins by delineating a study area of interest (**A**). A picture of the study area is then made by characterizing the distribution of environmental stressors (**B**) and the valued components (**C**) allowing the assessment objectives to be reached. The summation of all the environmental stressors allows us to identify the environments that are most exposed to cumulative stress, *i.e.* cumulative exposure (**D**). The sum of valued components, on the other hand, allows us to identify the environments in the study area where a higher number of valued components overlap (**E**). By combining the distribution of environmental stressors and valued components along with the vulnerability of the valued components to the environmental stressors, a relative assessment of individual effects is obtained (**F**). It is possible to assess the impact of all the environmental stressors on a single valued component (**G**); similarly, it is possible to assess the impact of a single environmental stressor on all valued components (**H**). Finding the sum of all the individual impacts provides the relative assessment of cumulative effects incorporating all combinations of environmental stressors and valued components (**I**).", out.width = '80%'}

### Network-scale assessment {#networkmethod}

The approach developed by @beauchesne2020c builds on recent progress in theoretical ecology [@stouffer2007; @stouffer2012; @beauchesne2021] to predict the net effects of environmental drivers by considering both direct and trophically-mediated indirect effects in ecological communities. By focusing on interactions rather than individual species, this approach provides the ability to consider how a focal species is affected by multiple environmental pressures, but also integrates how species it interacts with respond to the same pressures and how their response propagates to the species of interest. In terms of data requirements, this network-scale assessment builds on the same 3 modules as @halpern2008a, *i.e.* 1) the distribution of species ($S_i$), 2) the normalized distribution and intensity of environmental drivers ($D_j$), and 3) the species-specific sensitivity of each species to each driver ($\mu_{i,j}$); it considers 2 additional modules to complete the assessment: 4) the metaweb of species interactions, *i.e.* the network of binary biotic interactions structuring local food webs, and 5) the trophic sensitivity of species ($T_i$), *i.e.* their sensitivity to trophically-mediated indirect effects (see below for more details). 

The approach focuses on sub-networks of interacting species called motifs [@milo2002] and is conceptualized through Figure \@ref(fig:networkmethod). Motifs are subsets of $p$-species interactions that, when put together, construct whole food webs and provide a mesoscale characterization of the structural properties of ecological communities [@bascompte2005; @stouffer2007; @stouffer2010; @stouffer2011; @bramonmora2018]. In a $n$-species food web ($n \geq p$), the collection of $p$-species motifs ($p \leq n$) in which species $i$ is involved in ($M_i = \{m_{i,1},m_{i,2},...,m_{i,x}\}$) forms its motif census [$M_i$; @stouffer2012; @beauchesne2021]. The motif census provides an overview of all the interactions likely to affect the propagation of environmental pressure to a focal species. Only the most abundant 3-species motifs observed in empirical food webs are considered [*i.e.* trophic food chain, omnivory, exploitative and apparent composition; @camacho2007; @stouffer2010] to assess a species motif census.

For any 3-species motif $m_{i,x}$ in species $i$’s motif census ($M_i$), the net effect of all drivers on the 3 species is evaluated as the sum of their direct effects on all species involved -- that is, the sum of species-specific responses $S_{m_{i,x}}$ -- as in @halpern2008a:

$$S_{m_{i,x}} = \sum_{k=1}^3 \sum_j D_j * \mu_{k,j} \label{eq2}$$


where $k$ denotes the 3 species involved in motif $m_{i,x}$, $D_j$ is the standardized intensity of driver $j$ (scaled between 0 and 1; see [Environmental drivers module](#drmodule)) and $\mu_{k,j}$ is the relative species-specific sensitivity of species $k$ to driver $j$ (range between 0 and 1; see [Species-specific sensitivity module](#sssmodule)). The relative contribution of drivers to direct effects are those that affect focal species $i$, whereas the relative contribution to indirect effects are those that affect the species interacting with species $i$ in $m_{i,x}$.

A species sensitivity to trophically-mediated effects -- which we refer to as a species' trophic sensitivity ($T_{i,m_{i,x}}$) -- also depends on the structure of the community, its trophic position and the specific entry points of stressors in the system [see @beauchesne2021]. For instance, a predator in a food chain will more sensitive to the propagation of environmental pressures than a resource. We use simulated trophic sensitivities as weighting factors (scaled between 0 and 1) to modulate the effects of stressors to focal species $i$’s given its position in 3-species motifs and the specific pathways of effects -- *i.e.* the entry points -- through which stressors affect interacting species (see [Trophic sensitivity module](#trsmodule) and @beauchesne2021 for more details):

$$C_{i,m_{i,x}} = T_{i,m_{i,x}} * S_{m_{i,x}} \label{eq3}$$


where $C_{i,m_{i,x}}$ is the cumulative effect of all drivers on species $i$ in $m_{i,x}$, and $T_{i,m_{i,x}}$ is the trophic sensitivity of species $i$ to the effects of drivers in $m_{i,x}$. 

For a single species $i$, cumulative effects are then summarized by averaging the cumulative effects across its motif census to obtain an unbiased measure of the topological configuration of species interactions [@stouffer2012]:

$$C_{N_{i,x}} = \frac{1}{|M_i|} \sum_{m _{i,x} \in M_i} C_{i,m_{i,x}} \label{eq4}$$


where $C_{N_i}$ is the network-scale cumulative effects assessment on species $i$ and $|M_i|$ is the number of motifs in the motif census of species $i$. Finally, we summarize over all $n$ species locally to obtain a community-aggregated assessment of network-scale cumulative effects:

$$C_N = \sum_i C_{N_i} \label{eq5}$$

The full model for network-scale cumulative effects assessment is thus:

$$C_N = \sum_i \frac{1}{|M_i|} \sum_{m_{i,x} \in M_i} T_{i,m_{i,x}} * \sum_{k=1}^3 \sum_j D_j * \mu_{k,j} \label{eq6}$$
