## Species-specific sensitivity {#sssmodule}

We evaluated the relative species-specific sensitivity of all 205 taxa considered in the assessment to each stressor using a trait-matching approach, as in @beauchesne2020c. For each driver considered, @beauchesne2020c identified traits that were known or suspected to influence the sensitivity of a species to the direct effects of that particular driver. For instance, the feeding strategy of an organism can affect its sensitivity to certain stressors. Traits were categorized to reflect their relative contribution to the sensitivity of a taxa to the effects of a stressor and allow for a comparison between taxa. For example, suspension feeders are generally more affected by nutrients and metals than deposit feeders [@ellis2017]. 

@beauchesne2020c documented the body composition, the maximal body size, the type of marine environment in which species are found, the feeding mode, the mobility and the phylum of 391 taxa from the St. Lawrence. Traits data were extracted from the World Register of Marine Species [WoRMS; @wormseditorialboard2017], FishBase [@froese2019], SeaLifeBase [@palomares2019], the Encyclopedia of Life [EoL; @encyclopediaoflife2020] and the Global Biotic Interaction (GloBI) database [@poelen2014; @poelen2019].  We used the `taxize` [@chamberlain2013; @chamberlain2019], `worrms` [@chamberlain2020] and `rfishbase` [@boettiger2012] R packages to extract traits data. Manual searches, mainly on the WoRMS and EoL web portals, were performed and documented when programmatic extractions were unavailable. The traits dataset from @beauchesne2020c was updated for this assessment by using the same approach and resources to consider species of the Scotian Shelf, and to include species of marine mammals and sea birds that were not considered in @beauchesne2020c (Table \@ref(tab:sptraits)). Species that were targeted or caught as bycatch on the Scotian Shelf were also identified using the fisheries logbook data from DFO [@dfo2021b]. The code associated with traits extraction is available at [https://github.com/Ecosystem-Assessments/Species_Traits](https://github.com/Ecosystem-Assessments/Species_Traits).

For each trait and taxa combination, traits were given a weight between 0 and 1 to reflect the relative contribution of that trait to a species' sensitivity to a stressor. A weight of 0 means that a taxa possessing that trait is insensitive to a stressor, whereas a weight of 1 means that that trait renders a taxa highly sensitive to the effect of a stressor. In instances when a taxa had more than one trait (*e.g.* crawler and swimmer), the trait with the maximal sensitivity weight was retained. The sensitivity assessment was informed by expert knowledge and bibliographic research. Trait-matching rules and weights for each trait-stressor combination are available in Table \@ref(tab:spsensitivity). The relative sensitivity of each taxon was evaluated as the product of the weight given to all traits considered to assess the sensitivity of a given stressor. This process yielded a relative sensitivity assessment ranging between 0 and 1. The code to evaluate the relative sensitivity of taxa on the Scotian Shelf is available at [https://github.com/Ecosystem-Assessments/Species_direct_sensitivity](https://github.com/Ecosystem-Assessments/Species_direct_sensitivity).
