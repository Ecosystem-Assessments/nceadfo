# Background

In 2016, Fisheries and Oceans Canada renewed its research capacity to better understand the nature and extent of multiple anthropogenic stressors in the marine environment, in order to provide a foundation for policies and practices that protect the health of Canadaâ€™s oceans for future generations. This project was deemed relevant to Oceans and Climate Change science due to the need to  improve understanding of how multiple drivers interact to affect the integrity of ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales, and to improve evaluation of the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple drivers. Furthermore, marine spatial planning approaches for the use and conservation of marine resources are required, particularly in the context of fluctuating natural and human drivers. A recent project led by our team developed marine spatial planning approaches and tools to evaluate the cumulative effects of multiple environmental drivers on the ecological communities of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada [@beauchesne2020c], hereafter referred to as the St. Lawrence System. 

This  project identified four specific goals:

1. Evaluate the distribution and intensity of environmental drivers in the St. Lawrence System;
2. Characterize the spatial structure of the ecological communities of the St. Lawrence System;
3. Evaluate the vulnerability of ecological communities to multiple drivers;
4. Assess the cumulative effects of global changes on the ecological communities of the St. Lawrence System from the cartography of drivers (Obj. 1) and communities (Obj. 2), as well as the vulnerability of communities to multiple drivers (Obj 3).

A component of this project consisted of developing and launching the open knowledge platform [*eDrivers*](https://david-beauchesne.shinyapps.io/edriversapp/) [@beauchesne2020] to facilitate the process of gathering experts committed to structuring, standardizing and sharing knowledge on drivers in support of science and management. Data on 22 coastal, climate, fisheries and marine traffic drivers were summarized through collaborations, existing environmental initiatives and open data portals. The distribution of over 200 species was modeled and predicted throughout the St. Lawrence System, a simulation approach was used to infer the vulnerability of individual species in the St. Lawrence as a function of their position in complex food webs, and a spatially explicit evaluation of cumulative effects on the ecological communities of the St. Lawrence was generated. The current project aimed to apply and further develop the approaches and tools created in the St. Lawrence System to the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion using a species-distribution and vulnerability mapping approach. 

This project will benefit efficient, adaptive and holistic ecosystem-based management approaches that use marine spatial tools in the offshore Scotian Shelf Bioregion. Making data on drivers and ecological communities readily accessible will enhance the ability to provide efficient, consistent, and timely science guidance. This project will foster efficient and functional open science by using and further developing the fully open, transparent and replicable open knowledge platform *eDrivers*. This project also offers continuity and comparability between data products from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the offshore Scotian Shelf bioregion. Comparability between ecosystems is an important aspect to support the Oceans and Climate Change Science program at DFO. Furthermore, this project creates and generates data layers that will be useful for Marine Spatial Planning purposes.


# Scope and objectives of the assessment

## Objectives {#objectives}

The specific objectives of this project were to: 

1. provide a systematic characterization of the distribution and intensity of environmental drivers;
2. assess the spatial structure of biological communities;
3. evaluate the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple drivers, and;
4. conduct a spatial assessment of the cumulative effects of drivers on individual species and at the community level, using outputs from objectives 1 (distribution and intensity of drivers), 2 (spatial structure of biological communities), and 3 (food web vulnerability simulations due to multiple drivers).


## Spatial and temporal scope {#scope}

The region for which the cumulative effects assessment was conducted covers the Scotian Shelf Bioregion, located off the eastern coast of Canada in the Atlantic Ocean [Figure \@ref(fig:aoi); @dfo2009 @dfo2010]. The study area includes the Bay of Fundy to the West, stop just before the Laurentian Channel to the East, and extends towards the continental shelf. The whole study area covers an area of 415 341 $km^2$. For this assessment, we divided this area in a regular grid formed of cells of ~1 $km^2$.

The temporal scope of the data was defined by the availability of data on environmental drivers on the Scotian Shelf Bioregion; we considered data from 2010 up to today and divided the assessment in two periods, *i.e.* from 2010 to 2015 (period 1) and from 2016 to 2021 (period 2). Drivers data for which temporal timeseries spanning this timeframe were unavailable (*e.g.* shipping) used the same data for both periods (see section \@ref(drmodule) and Table \@ref(tab:drnm)). Data on species occurrences were not divided by period and a single distribution was modelled for all species considered in the assessment (see section \@ref(spmodule)).
